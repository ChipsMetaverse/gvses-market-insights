# ElevenLabs Agent Configuration - Final Report

## Executive Summary
We have successfully configured the ElevenLabs agent "Gsves Market Insights" with proper tools, but there is a platform issue preventing tool calls from working correctly.

## ‚úÖ What We Successfully Completed

### 1. Tool Creation and Configuration
- **Created 8 new tools** with correct webhook URLs pointing to production backend
- **Tool IDs generated**:
  - `tool_7001k3t333e6ejktsrpht14ab0jf` - get_stock_price
  - `tool_4201k3t333xkfet9w9zteq4tzvt2` - get_market_overview
  - `tool_8301k3t334byfpd91sgbg1q5rw5t` - get_stock_news
  - `tool_0801k3t334tvfkmrj3epg5kapxdz` - get_stock_history
  - `tool_7501k3t3359hejgbdemab3ywgf4x` - get_comprehensive_stock_data
  - `tool_9301k3t335rffk9aat8vw67ah89x` - get_market_movers
  - `tool_1701k3t3367hfjjvgdbcc3m2fhy0` - get_analyst_ratings
  - `tool_5701k3t336p6e3tajvxppc4as8ph` - get_options_chain
- **All tools verified** to have correct production URLs (`https://gvses-market-insights.fly.dev`)

### 2. Agent Configuration Updates
- **Agent ID verified**: `agent_4901k2tkkq54f4mvgpndm3pgzm7g` (Gsves Market Insights)
- **Updated to use GPT-4o** for better capabilities
- **Added tool_ids** referencing the 8 created tools
- **G'sves personality** maintained (30+ years market experience)
- **Removed inline tools** from local configuration

### 3. Backend Verification
All production endpoints tested and working:
- `/api/stock-price` - Returns real market data
- `/api/market-overview` - Returns market indices
- `/api/stock-news` - Returns news articles
- All other endpoints responding correctly

### 4. Configuration Management
- **ConvAI CLI installed** and configured
- **Project structure created** in `elevenlabs/` directory
- **Local configuration updated** and synced
- **Multiple update attempts** via API and CLI

## ‚ùå The Remaining Issue

### Platform Bug: Inline Tools Persist
Despite multiple attempts to remove them, the inline `tools` array persists in the agent configuration alongside `tool_ids`. This creates a conflict that prevents tools from being called.

**Evidence of the issue:**
```python
Has tool_ids: True (8 tools)  ‚úÖ
Has inline tools: True         ‚ùå  # Should be False
```

**What we tried:**
1. API PATCH requests explicitly removing tools field
2. ConvAI CLI sync with tools removed from config
3. Force update with completely rebuilt configuration
4. Multiple approaches to override the configuration

**Result:** The ElevenLabs platform continues to retain the inline tools even when they're not included in update requests.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be a bug in the ElevenLabs platform where:
1. When an agent has inline tools defined, they cannot be removed via API updates
2. Having both `tool_ids` AND inline `tools` creates a conflict
3. The platform prioritizes inline tools over tool_ids, but inline tools don't work properly

## üìã Files Created

### Scripts
- `fix_tools_properly.py` - Creates tools via API with correct configuration
- `update_agent_tools.py` - Updates agent to use tool_ids
- `force_remove_inline_tools.py` - Attempts to force remove inline tools
- `test_tool_calling.py` - WebSocket testing script
- `test_simulation.py` - Simulation API testing script
- `test_explicit_tool.py` - Tests with explicit tool requests

### Configuration
- `tool_ids.json` - Contains the 8 created tool IDs
- `elevenlabs/agent_configs/gsves_market_insights.json` - Local agent config (tools removed)
- `elevenlabs/convai.lock` - Lock file with agent ID

### Documentation
- `CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed configuration documentation
- `FINAL_REPORT.md` - This comprehensive report

## üí° Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Contact ElevenLabs Support
Provide them with:
- Agent ID: `agent_4901k2tkkq54f4mvgpndm3pgzm7g`
- Issue: Cannot remove inline tools array via API updates
- Impact: Tools not being called despite proper configuration

### Option 2: Create New Agent
Since the existing agent seems corrupted with persistent inline tools:
1. Create a brand new agent via API or CLI
2. Configure with tool_ids only (no inline tools from the start)
3. This should avoid the conflict entirely

### Option 3: Use Different Tool Approach
If ElevenLabs supports it:
- Try client-side tools instead of webhooks
- Use a custom LLM endpoint that handles tool calling
- Implement tools through a different mechanism

## üìä Technical Details

### Current Configuration State
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "prompt": {
      "llm": "gpt-4o",
      "tool_ids": [/* 8 tools */],
      "tools": [/* 8 inline tools - SHOULD NOT BE HERE */]
    }
  }
}
```

### Expected Configuration
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "prompt": {
      "llm": "gpt-4o",
      "tool_ids": [/* 8 tools */]
      // No "tools" field
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Success Criteria (Not Yet Met)
- [ ] Agent calls tools when asked about stock prices
- [ ] Returns real market data (e.g., Bitcoin ~$111k, not hallucinated values)
- [ ] Tools execute and return results within conversation

## üìù Conclusion

We have successfully:
1. Created all necessary tools with correct configurations
2. Updated the agent to reference these tools
3. Verified all backend endpoints are working
4. Documented the entire process thoroughly

However, a platform issue with ElevenLabs prevents the inline tools from being removed, which blocks tool execution. This appears to be a bug in their API that requires their support team's intervention or creating a new agent from scratch.
