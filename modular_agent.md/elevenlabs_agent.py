~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module contains a skeleton for interacting with ElevenLabsâ€™ Conversational
AI platform via WebSocket.  In a live deployment the assistant would
authenticate with your ElevenLabs agent ID and API key, send microphone audio
in real time, and play back the generated speech audio.  Here we provide a
simplified version that demonstrates the expected control flow without making
any external network calls.

To use this module with the real ElevenLabs API you will need to:

1. Install the `websockets` package (`pip install websockets`).
2. Set environment variables `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID`.
3. Replace the `stream_conversation` coroutine with code that connects to
   `wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation?agent_id=...` and handles
   streaming audio in/out according to the ElevenLabs documentation.

For details see the official docs at
https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/getting-started and the
examples provided in the project.
