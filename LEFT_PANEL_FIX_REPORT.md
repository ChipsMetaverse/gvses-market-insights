# Left Panel Data Failure - Root Cause & Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  

---

## üö® Problem Summary

The left panel in production was completely broken:
- ‚ùå Technical levels showing `$---` (placeholders)
- ‚ùå No news loading
- ‚ùå No pattern detection
- ‚ùå 500 errors on `/api/technical-indicators`
- ‚ùå MCP Server returning "Unknown tool" errors

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Tool Name Mismatch (CRITICAL)

The HTTP handler in `market-mcp-server/index.js` had **THREE critical bugs**:

#### Bug 1: Wrong Tool Names in Switch Statement
**Lines 2557-2574 (HTTP handler)**
```javascript
switch (name) {
  case 'get_stock_quote':
  case 'get_quote':
    result = await this.getQuote(args);  // ‚ùå METHOD DOESN'T EXIST!
```

**Lines 600-601 (STDIO handler - correct)**
```javascript
case 'get_stock_quote':
  result = await this.getStockQuote(args);  // ‚úÖ CORRECT METHOD
```

#### Bug 2: News Method Name Wrong
**HTTP handler called:**
```javascript
case 'get_market_news':
  result = await this.getStockNews(args);  // ‚ùå METHOD DOESN'T EXIST!
```

**Should call (line 1384):**
```javascript
async getMarketNews(args) {  // ‚úÖ ACTUAL METHOD NAME
```

#### Bug 3: Technical Indicators Method Name Wrong
**HTTP handler called:**
```javascript
case 'get_technical_indicators':
  result = await this.calculateTechnicalIndicators(args);  // ‚ùå METHOD DOESN'T EXIST!
```

**Should call (line 1480):**
```javascript
async getTechnicalIndicators(args) {  // ‚úÖ ACTUAL METHOD NAME
```

### Issue 2: Tools/List Response Had Wrong Names

The HTTP endpoint's `tools/list` response advertised incorrect tool names:
- Listed: `get_quote` ‚ùå
- Should be: `get_stock_quote` ‚úÖ

This caused confusion between what tools were available vs. what the backend was calling.

## üîß The Fix

### Commit 1: `08aad2d` - Fixed tool names in tools/list
- Updated `get_quote` ‚Üí `get_stock_quote`
- Updated `get_stock_news` ‚Üí `get_market_news`
- Updated `calculate_technical_indicators` ‚Üí `get_technical_indicators`

### Commit 2: `e1f526c` - Fixed method calls (CRITICAL)
**Changed HTTP handler switch cases to call correct methods:**

```diff
  case 'get_stock_quote':
  case 'get_quote':
-   result = await this.getQuote(args);
+   result = await this.getStockQuote(args);
    break;
    
  case 'get_market_news':
  case 'get_stock_news':
-   result = await this.getStockNews(args);
+   result = await this.getMarketNews(args);
    break;
    
  case 'get_technical_indicators':
  case 'calculate_technical_indicators':
-   result = await this.calculateTechnicalIndicators(args);
+   result = await this.getTechnicalIndicators(args);
    break;
```

## üìä Evidence of the Bug

### Backend Logs (Before Fix)
```

ERROR:services.http_mcp_client:Failed to call MCP tool get_stock_quote via HTTP: MCP HTTP error: 500

```

### MCP Server Logs (Before Fix)
```
[HTTP] Received request: tools/call
[HTTP] Error: Unknown tool: get_technical_indicators
[HTTP] Received request: tools/call
[HTTP] Error: Unknown tool: get_market_news
[HTTP] Received request: tools/call

```

### API Response (Before Fix)
```json

  "symbol": "TSLA",
  "price_data": {},
  "technical_levels": {},
  "data_source": "error",
  "error": "Unable to fetch real historical data for TSLA",
  "news": []
}
```

## üéØ Why This Happened

When we migrated from **STDIO to HTTP mode** for the MCP server:

1. ‚úÖ **STDIO handler** was correctly calling `getStockQuote()`, `getMarketNews()`, `getTechnicalIndicators()`
2. ‚ùå **HTTP handler** was newly written but used **WRONG method names** copied from a different implementation
3. ‚ùå The HTTP handler was **never tested** with actual backend calls
4. ‚ùå The tool names in `tools/list` didn't match what the backend expected

The STDIO code path worked perfectly. The HTTP code path was fundamentally broken.

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### After Deployment
1. **Check MCP server logs** - should see successful tool calls, no "Unknown tool" errors
2. **Check backend logs** - should see successful HTTP responses from MCP server
3. **Test comprehensive data API**:
   ```bash
   curl https://gvses-market-insights.fly.dev/api/comprehensive-stock-data?symbol=TSLA | jq .
   ```
   Should return actual technical levels, not empty objects.

4. **Test left panel in browser**:
   - Technical levels should populate with real prices
   - News should load
   - Pattern detection should show actual patterns or "No patterns detected"

## üîÑ Related Files

### Files Changed
- `market-mcp-server/index.js` (lines 2499-2574)

### Files Affected (Not Changed)
- `backend/services/http_mcp_client.py` - Was calling correct tool names all along
- `backend/services/market_service.py` - Was calling correct tool names
- `backend/services/news_service.py` - Was calling correct tool names
- `backend/routers/enhanced_market_router.py` - Was calling correct tool names

**Conclusion**: The backend was correct. Only the MCP server's HTTP handler was wrong.

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Test both code paths**: When maintaining dual modes (STDIO + HTTP), ensure BOTH are tested
2. **Method name consistency**: Don't copy/paste code without verifying method names exist
3. **Integration testing**: Need automated tests that verify HTTP endpoints actually work
4. **Logging is critical**: The detailed error messages led us directly to the root cause

## üöÄ Expected Results After Fix

Once the deployment completes:

‚úÖ Left panel technical levels populate with real values  
‚úÖ News articles load correctly  
‚úÖ Pattern detection functions properly  
‚úÖ No "Unknown tool" errors in MCP logs  
‚úÖ No 500 errors on `/api/technical-indicators`  
‚úÖ Comprehensive stock data API returns complete data

## üìå Deployment

**Commits**:
- `08aad2d` - Fixed tool names in tools/list response
- `e1f526c` - Fixed HTTP handler method calls (CRITICAL FIX)

**Pushed to**: `master` branch  
**Auto-deploys to**: `gvses-market-insights.fly.dev`  

**Monitor deployment**:
```bash
fly logs -a gvses-market-insights
```

Look for: `Market MCP Server running in HTTP mode on port 3001`
