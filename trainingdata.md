Powering Lightweight Trading Charts with External Data

TradingView’s Lightweight Charts library is purely a charting library – it does not come with any market data feed out of the box. This means you must supply your own price data (historical and real-time) from an external source ￼. In a trading application (especially one you plan to monetize), you’ll need to choose a data provider carefully. Below we outline where to obtain free market data for your charts and how to integrate it into a React + Vite frontend with a Supabase backend.

TradingView and Data Feeds: The Basics

TradingView does not provide an API for you to pull price data directly for your own app – their libraries expect you to plug in your own data source ￼. In fact, TradingView’s documentation explicitly states that neither the Lightweight Charts nor the full Charting Library include any market data; you must connect third-party or custom data feeds ￼. For example, TradingView provides a sample “Yahoo datafeed” backend on GitHub for developers to study, underscoring that you’re meant to bring your own data (in this case from Yahoo Finance) ￼.

Key point: If you’ve seen TradingView’s charts on their website with live data, note that those use TradingView’s own infrastructure and data agreements. When using the open-source Lightweight Charts library, you are responsible for sourcing data (either via APIs or databases).

Free Market Data Sources for Your Charts

Since you need to fetch data externally, here are some popular free data sources and APIs that can power your trading charts. Keep in mind the limitations and terms of each, especially since your app will be a paid service (commercial use):
	•	Yahoo Finance API (Unofficial): Yahoo Finance provides free delayed data for stocks, ETFs, currencies, etc., which many developers scrape or query via unofficial endpoints. There’s no official public Yahoo Finance REST API, but Yahoo’s JSON data endpoints can be accessed for charts. TradingView’s own sample backend uses Yahoo Finance as a data source ￼. Pros: Wide coverage (global equities, forex, crypto, etc.) and no API key required. Cons: Unofficial (endpoints can change) and data is typically delayed ~15 minutes for stocks. For a commercial app, using Yahoo’s data may violate Yahoo’s terms if you redistribute it, so proceed with caution.
	•	Alpha Vantage: A well-known free API for stock, forex, and crypto data. Alpha Vantage covers global stocks, FX rates, cryptocurrencies, and even technical indicators ￼. However, their free tier was recently limited to 25 API requests per day ￼ ￼, which is extremely low (it used to allow 500/day). This means the free plan is only suitable for minimal usage (e.g. a few symbols’ daily data). They offer paid plans for higher usage. Pros: Broad asset class coverage and historical data (decades of history for many stocks) ￼. Cons: Very tight free limits (25 calls/day ￼) – likely insufficient for real-time charts unless you upgrade. If you do upgrade, Alpha Vantage is a solid alternative with licensed data (compliant with exchange requirements) ￼.
	•	Twelve Data: Twelve Data is another financial data API covering stocks, forex, and crypto globally. It has a more generous free plan: 8 API calls per minute, up to 800 calls per day ￼. This can be enough for light real-time usage or for retrieving historical time series for several symbols. You’ll need to sign up for a free API key. Pros: Decent free rate limits (e.g. you could update ~8 symbols per minute or fetch intraday data periodically) and broad market coverage. Cons: Requires API key and like others, commercial use might require a higher-tier plan. Check their terms if your app scales up.
	•	Finnhub.io: Finnhub offers free real-time APIs for stocks, forex, and crypto with relatively high limits (60 API calls/minute on the free tier) and even WebSocket streams for live prices. However, Finnhub’s free tier is intended for non-commercial use – the provider has stated that you must obtain a commercial license for a for-profit application ￼. Technically, it’s very capable (real-time US stock quotes, etc.), but using the free API in a paid product would violate their terms. Pros: Real-time quotes and generous limits for testing/personal use. Cons: Not legally free for commercial projects without a paid license.
	•	Crypto Exchange APIs: If your application needs cryptocurrency data, most crypto exchanges provide free public APIs. For example, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc. have REST and WebSocket endpoints that provide real-time price ticks and historical candlestick data. Crypto data is generally free and open. You could connect directly to these APIs (via REST calls or opening a WebSocket for live updates) for any crypto symbols. Pros: Truly real-time data and no strict rate limiting (for reasonable use) for crypto. Cons: You may need to integrate multiple exchange APIs if you want many trading pairs or use an aggregator like CryptoCompare. (Note: TradingView’s official tutorial for their charting library uses CryptoCompare’s free API for historical crypto data ￼).
	•	Other Sources (IEX, Polygon, etc.): In the past, the IEX Cloud API was a popular free-ish source for US stock data, but IEX Cloud shut down in 2024. Polygon.io and Tiingo offer free trials or limited free plans (Polygon has end-of-day data free, live data requires a paid plan). Quandl/Nasdaq Data Link provides some free datasets (mostly end-of-day or fundamentals). These might be less useful for real-time chart updates but can supplement historical data. If your app needs indices or commodities data, you might find free sources for delayed quotes (e.g. Stooq or Investing.com for CSV data), but for real-time/professional use, consider paid providers.
	•	Open-Source Aggregators (MCP Servers): Since you mentioned “mcp servers”, there is an open-source project called mg-mcp-server that acts as a data API aggregator. It integrates Alpha Vantage and Yahoo Finance under a unified local server interface ￼. Essentially, you run this server and it fetches data from those free sources for you, applying caching and a unified query format (it uses a “Model-Context Protocol” or MCP). This can be a creative solution to combine multiple free sources: for example, pull some data from Yahoo and some from Alpha Vantage. Pros: You control the server, can cache results, and avoid writing API calls from scratch. Cons: Still bound by the limits of the upstream sources (Alpha Vantage’s 25/day, etc.) and you’ll need to deploy/maintain this server. If your voice assistant app already uses an MCP server, you can extend it to serve chart data endpoints (e.g. an HTTP API like /historical?symbol=XYZ that your frontend can call).

Reminder: When using any “free” data for a commercial (subscriber-based) app, review the provider’s terms of service. Many free APIs allow evaluation or personal use but require a paid license for production or commercial use. For example, Yahoo’s data is free but not officially licensed for republishing; Alpha Vantage and Twelve Data might expect you to upgrade for higher or commercial usage; and Finnhub explicitly disallows unpaid commercial use ￼. Using multiple free sources in combination (and caching data in your database) could mitigate rate limits, but as your app grows you may eventually need to invest in a paid data feed for reliability and compliance.

Implementing the Data Feed with React, Vite, and Supabase

Once you’ve chosen a data source (or multiple sources), the next step is integrating that data into your React application’s charts. Here’s a step-by-step approach to implement the data feed in a React + Vite frontend, using Supabase as a backend:

1. Fetching or Storing Data via Supabase

Supabase can play two roles: direct database storage for market data or as a proxy server to call external APIs.
	•	Option A: Call APIs from the Frontend: For quick prototypes, you can fetch data directly from the client (React) using fetch() or libraries like axios. For example, you might call Yahoo Finance’s endpoint or Twelve Data’s REST API from a React useEffect. After getting the JSON data, transform it to the format needed by Lightweight Charts (an array of objects with time and price fields) and then use series.setData(data) or series.update(newPoint) to render it. However, calling third-party APIs from the browser has downsides: CORS restrictions (many financial APIs don’t allow client-side calls), exposure of API keys, and lack of caching.
	•	Option B: Use Supabase as a Backend Proxy: A more robust approach is to have your Supabase backend fetch and supply the data:
	•	Supabase Edge Functions: Supabase allows you to deploy serverless functions (written in Node/TypeScript) that run on the backend. You could write an Edge Function that, for example, hits the Alpha Vantage API (using your API key stored securely) and returns the data to the client. Your React app would call this function (it becomes an HTTP endpoint) to get chart data. This keeps API keys hidden and bypasses CORS issues (since the function is server-side) ￼.
	•	Database + Scheduled Jobs: If you need to display historical data, you can periodically fetch data from an API and store it in Supabase’s Postgres database. For instance, you might have a prices table with columns for symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume. You could run a cron job or use Supabase’s background tasks to update this table (or simply fetch on demand and insert). The React app can then query the Supabase database (via Supabase JS client or REST API) for the chart data. Supabase’s Postgres can handle a decent amount of data, and you’d offload frequent API calls by serving cached data from your DB.
	•	Realtime via Supabase: Supabase has built-in Realtime capabilities for database changes. If you stream live prices into a table (e.g., insert a new row for each latest price or update a “current price” row), the Supabase client can subscribe to those changes. This means your React app can receive live updates pushed from the database, and you can use that to update the chart in real-time. Supabase achieves this by listening to Postgres INSERT/UPDATE and broadcasting changes to subscribers over websockets ￼. For example, if your backend inserts a new 1-minute candlestick every minute, all connected clients can get that data instantly and you can call series.update(newBar) to append it to the chart.

Tip: If you already have an MCP server or other data source feeding your voice assistant, consider hooking that into Supabase. For instance, your MCP server could push data to Supabase (or your app server) which then writes to the database or directly emits to the client.

2. Integrating with React (Vite)

With data access in place, integrating it into React follows typical patterns:
	•	Chart Component: Create a React component for the chart (e.g. <PriceChart symbol="AAPL" />). Inside, use the Lightweight Charts library by calling createChart and adding a series. When the component mounts, fetch the historical data needed:

useEffect(() => {
  async function loadData() {
    const resp = await fetch(`/api/getPrices?symbol=${symbol}`);  // your Supabase function or API
    const priceData = await resp.json();
    const formattedData = priceData.map(pt => ({
      time: pt.timestamp, 
      open: pt.open, high: pt.high, low: pt.low, close: pt.close
    }));
    candlestickSeries.setData(formattedData);
  }
  loadData();
}, [symbol]);

In this snippet, /api/getPrices could be a route that calls Supabase or an Edge Function to retrieve data. Once data is fetched, we format it for a candlestick series and call setData to plot it. If you just want a line chart of closing prices, you can supply { time, value } points instead.

	•	Real-Time Updates: If using real-time data (say via WebSocket or Supabase Realtime), establish that connection in a useEffect as well. For example, if using Supabase:

useEffect(() => {
  const channel = supabase
    .channel('realtime:public:prices')
    .on('postgres_changes', { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'prices', filter: `symbol=eq.${symbol}` },
        payload => {
           const newBar = payload.new;  // the inserted row
           candlestickSeries.update({
              time: newBar.timestamp,
              open: newBar.open, high: newBar.high, low: newBar.low, close: newBar.close
           });
        }
    )
    .subscribe();
  return () => { supabase.removeChannel(channel); }
}, [symbol]);

This would live-update the chart whenever a new price row is inserted for that symbol. Likewise, if using a pure WebSocket from a data API (for example, a crypto exchange feed that sends price ticks), you’d listen to the socket messages and call series.update({...}) with the new data point.

	•	Performance & Cleanup: Because Vite is just your build tool, the integration is essentially the same as any React app. Ensure you clean up subscriptions on unmount (close WebSocket, unsubscribe from Supabase realtime channel, etc.) to prevent memory leaks. Also, charts can accumulate a lot of data if not managed – you might implement a sliding window of points for real-time (removing old points to keep the chart snappy, unless you need infinite scroll back). The Lightweight Charts library can handle large datasets (see “infinite scroll” examples) but you’ll control how much to load at once. If implementing on-demand loading of older data (e.g., user scrolls back to load more history), you can call additional API endpoints to fetch historical segments and use series.setData or series.update accordingly.

3. Supabase Authentication and Access Control

Since your app is subscriber-based, you can use Supabase Auth to ensure only paid users can access the data endpoints or the subscription. For example, your Supabase Edge Function can verify the requesting user’s JWT to ensure they are authorized (Supabase provides the user context to your functions). Similarly, if you are storing data in Supabase, you can create Row Level Security (RLS) policies such that only certain roles can select from the prices table (or perhaps you create a secure API key for your Edge Function). This is more about app security, but important since you don’t want to inadvertently expose your data feed to non-subscribers.

4. Testing and Iteration

When you first integrate, start with a single source and get a basic chart working. For instance, try pulling a few days of one stock’s prices from Yahoo or Alpha Vantage into a chart. Once that pipeline works, you can expand to multiple symbols, real-time updates, and additional features (indicators, etc.). Verify that data is displaying correctly – common issues include timestamps format (Lightweight Charts expects UNIX timestamps in seconds, or string dates like "yyyy-mm-dd" by default) and ensuring the data is sorted by time. If data isn’t showing or looks wrong, check the format carefully and use the developer console. (The TradingView FAQ suggests enabling debug logs in the chart library if you have issues with data loading ￼).

Conclusion and Key Takeaways

In summary, TradingView’s Lightweight Charts gives you a powerful visualization tool, but you must supply your own market data. If TradingView doesn’t provide data (which it doesn’t for custom apps), you can obtain it from various free APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data, or others – each with their own limits and licensing considerations. In your React/Vite frontend, use those APIs (via Supabase functions or direct fetch calls) to retrieve the data and feed it into the chart using the library’s API (setData, update, etc.). Your Supabase backend can help orchestrate data fetching, caching, and real-time distribution to clients.

By combining these tools, you can display live updating charts in your trading application – effectively creating a “virtual market assistant” that charts asset prices in real time. Just be sure to plan for scalability: as your subscriber base grows, you might transition from free data sources to more robust paid feeds to ensure reliability and compliance. For now, leveraging the above free sources creatively (and caching results in your own database) can get you started with minimal cost, which is great for an MVP or initial launch of your app. Good luck, and happy coding!
