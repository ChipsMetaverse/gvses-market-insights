- **Test Result**: Pattern verdict submission succeeded

### âœ… Enhanced Distributed Stats
- **Endpoint**: `GET /distributed/stats`
- **Enhancement**: Worker observability metrics (CPU, memory, leases)
- **Status**: Returning enhanced data structure with worker health
- **Test Result**: Distributed stats include enhanced observability fields

### âœ… WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Endpoint**: `ws://localhost:3100/ws`
- **Enhancement**: Pattern overlay broadcasting capability
- **Status**: Infrastructure ready, connection handling operational
- **Test Result**: WebSocket connects and handles messages

### âœ… Worker Health Monitoring
- **Component**: DistributedQueue class
- **Features**: 
  - Real-time CPU/memory usage tracking
  - Lease management with automatic renewal (2-minute intervals)
  - Orphan job recovery (5-minute timeout)
- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested

### âœ… Webhook Alert Service
- **Component**: WebhookService extensions
- **New Methods**:
  - `triggerWorkerOfflineAlert()`
  - `triggerWorkerOverloadedAlert()`
  - `triggerQueueBacklogAlert()`
  - `triggerOrphanJobsAlert()`
- **Status**: Implemented with retry logic

## Architecture Documentation

### Updated Documents
- âœ… `mermaid.md` - Added Phase 3 diagrams and status
- âœ… `HEADLESS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated with Phase 3 implementation details

### New Diagrams
- Pattern Detection and Verdict Flow sequence diagram
- Worker Health Observability Architecture diagram

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/phase3-regression.yml`
- Runs on: Push to main/develop, PRs, nightly at 2 AM UTC
- Services: PostgreSQL, Backend, Headless Service
- Tests: Phase 3 regression suite
- Notifications: Slack on failure, auto-issue creation

### Integration Commands
```bash
# Local testing
cd backend && python test_phase3_regression.py

# Docker integration
docker-compose run backend python test_phase3_regression.py

# CI/CD pipeline
npm run test:regression
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] All Phase 3 features implemented
- [x] Regression tests passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] CI/CD workflow configured
- [x] Verification evidence archived

### Production Readiness
- [x] Pattern verdict API tested with real data
- [x] Worker health metrics generating correctly
- [x] WebSocket infrastructure operational
- [x] Webhook alerts configured
- [x] Enhanced stats endpoint returning data

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor pattern verdict submissions
- [ ] Track worker health metrics
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections
- [ ] Check webhook delivery rates
- [ ] Review distributed stats accuracy

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Pattern verdict API is backward compatible
- Enhanced stats are additive (no breaking changes)
- WebSocket infrastructure doesn't affect existing features

### Mitigations
- Regression tests catch any breaking changes
- Feature flags can disable new features if needed
- Rollback plan: Previous version remains deployable
