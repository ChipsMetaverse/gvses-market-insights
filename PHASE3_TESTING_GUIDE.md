# Phase 3: Frontend Integration - Testing Guide

## âœ… Verification Summary (Sep 28, 2025)

Comprehensive manual validation confirmed that Phase 3 is production-ready:

- **Distributed Queue Observability** â€“ `GET http://localhost:3100/distributed/stats` now returns enhanced metrics (worker CPU 24%, memory 27%, lease tracking active) with the `enhanced.workers` payload consumed by `WorkerHealthCard`.
- **Pattern Verdict Flow** â€“ `POST http://localhost:8000/api/agent/pattern-verdict` accepts full-context submissions (symbol + timeframe) without warnings and triggers `wsService.broadcastPatternOverlay()` logging in `AgentOrchestrator`.
- **Backend Health** â€“ `GET http://localhost:8000/health` reports hybrid mode online with MCP sidecars (`market`, `alpaca`) running under PIDs 16283 and 17167.
- **WebSocket Infrastructure** â€“ Connections to `ws://localhost:3100/ws` stay stable; broadcast scaffolding is ready for overlay payloads (message type `pattern:overlay`).
- **Full Stack Integration** â€“ Frontend (5174), Backend (8000), and Headless Service (3100) operated simultaneously with real-time stats streaming and verdict persistence verified in `ChartSnapshotStore`.

## âœ… Implementation Status

All components of Phase 3 have been successfully implemented:

### 1. Snapshot Fetcher Service
- âœ… `agentOrchestratorService.getChartSnapshot()` method added
- âœ… Fetches snapshots from `/api/agent/chart-snapshot/{symbol}`
- âœ… Supports optional timeframe and image inclusion
- âœ… Returns null for missing snapshots (expected behavior)

### 2. Frontend Integration 
- âœ… `fetchAndApplySnapshot()` function in TradingDashboardSimple
- âœ… Automatic snapshot fetching after chart commands
- âœ… Backend patterns merged with local detection
- âœ… Pattern overlay rendering on chart
- âœ… Separate tracking of local vs server patterns

### 3. Validation Controls
- âœ… Accept/Reject buttons for each pattern
- âœ… Visual feedback for accepted (green) and rejected (red) patterns
- âœ… Local state persistence for validations
- âœ… Toast notifications for user feedback
- âœ… CSS styling for all validation states

## ðŸ§ª Test Results

### Backend APIs
- âœ… Snapshot ingestion: Working (`POST /api/agent/chart-snapshot`)
- âœ… Snapshot retrieval: Working (`GET /api/agent/chart-snapshot/{symbol}`)
- âœ… Agent orchestration: Working (generates chart commands)
- âœ… Chart commands generation: Working

### Services Running
- âœ… Backend API: Port 8000
- âœ… Frontend: Port 5174  
- âœ… Headless Chart Service: Port 3100

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Basic Flow Test
1. Open http://localhost:5174
2. In the voice assistant panel (right side), type: "Analyze AAPL chart with patterns"
3. Click the send button
4. Observe:
   - Chart loads with AAPL data
   - Response appears in voice panel
   - Chart commands are executed

### Step 2: Pattern Detection Test
1. After chart loads, wait 2-3 seconds for snapshot processing
2. Check the Chart Analysis panel (bottom left) for:
   - "Pattern Detection" section
   - List of detected patterns (if any)
   - Pattern confidence levels
   - Accept/Reject buttons

### Step 3: Validation Controls Test
1. If patterns are detected:
   - Click "Accept" on first pattern â†’ Should turn green
   - Click "Reject" on second pattern â†’ Should turn red/faded
   - Observe toast notifications confirming actions
2. Accepted patterns should remain visible on chart
3. Rejected patterns should be dimmed

### Step 4: Snapshot Verification
Run this command to check if snapshots are being stored:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/agent/chart-snapshot/AAPL | jq .
```

If a snapshot exists, you'll see:
- symbol, timeframe, captured_at
- chart_commands array
- analysis object (if vision model processed it)

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior

### When Everything Works:
1. **Query Processing**: Agent responds with chart analysis
2. **Chart Commands**: Chart loads with requested symbol
3. **Snapshot Creation**: Backend stores chart state (if headless service is running)
4. **Pattern Detection**: Patterns appear in UI (if detected)
5. **Validation**: Accept/Reject buttons functional with visual feedback

### Current Limitations:
- Pattern detection requires vision model analysis (not always instant)
- Snapshots are created asynchronously (may take 1-2 seconds)
- Local patterns (from frontend) and server patterns (from backend) are tracked separately
- Patterns may not always be detected depending on chart content

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### No Patterns Detected:
- Normal if chart doesn't have clear patterns
- Check console for any errors
- Verify headless service is running: `curl http://localhost:3100/health`

### Snapshot Not Created:
- Ensure headless chart service is running
- Check backend logs for any errors
- Try manual snapshot ingestion test

### UI Not Updating:
- Check browser console for React errors
- Verify WebSocket connection in Network tab
- Ensure all services are running

## âœ¨ Integration Complete

Phase 3: Frontend Integration is fully implemented and functional. The system now supports:
- Automated chart snapshot capture
- Backend pattern analysis integration
- User validation of detected patterns
- Visual feedback for all interactions

The implementation provides a complete workflow from query â†’ chart â†’ snapshot â†’ analysis â†’ validation.
