**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå No permission prompt
- ‚ùå Connection shows "connected" but no microphone request
- ‚ùå Console error: "Microphone access denied"

---

### Test 2: Passive Mode Verification (CRITICAL)
**Expected Behavior**: OpenAI should remain SILENT after connection

**Steps**:
1. Connect voice (microphone active)
2. Wait 5 seconds in complete silence
3. Check browser console

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] **NO** `response.audio_transcript.delta` events in console
- [ ] **NO** auto-greeting from AI
- [ ] **NO** autonomous responses to silence
- [ ] Console shows: `‚úÖ GA-compliant session configured: PASSIVE voice I/O`

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå `response.audio_transcript.delta` events appear
- ‚ùå AI speaks without user input
- ‚ùå Console shows OpenAI generating text autonomously

---

### Test 3: User Speech Recognition (STT)
**Expected Behavior**: User speech should be transcribed accurately

**Steps**:
1. With microphone active, speak clearly: **"What is the price of Tesla?"**
2. Monitor browser console

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Console shows: `üìù [USER STT] New user speech started - ID: <id>`
- [ ] Console shows: `üìù [USER STT] Transcript: "what is the price of Tesla"`
- [ ] Console shows: `‚úÖ [FINAL] User speech completed, emitting final transcript`
- [ ] Console shows: `‚úÖ [AGENT VOICE] Sending to agent: what is the price of Tesla`

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå No transcript appears
- ‚ùå Transcript is for "assistant" role instead of "user"
- ‚ùå Transcript incomplete or cut off

---

### Test 4: Agent Response Generation
**Expected Behavior**: Agent should process query and return market data

**Steps**:
1. After speaking "What is the price of Tesla?"
2. Wait for agent processing
3. Check console for agent response

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Console shows: `üìä [AGENT] Calling tool: get_stock_price`
- [ ] Console shows: `‚úÖ [AGENT] Tool result:` with Tesla price data
- [ ] Console shows: `ü§ñ [AGENT] Generated response:` with formatted answer
- [ ] Response includes current Tesla price (e.g., "$234.56")

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå Empty response: `I couldn't generate a response`
- ‚ùå Response cut off (token limit issue)
- ‚ùå Tool call fails or times out

---

### Test 5: Text-to-Speech (TTS) Output
**Expected Behavior**: Agent response should be spoken aloud

**Steps**:
1. After agent generates response
2. Listen for audio playback

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Console shows: `üì§ Sending text for TTS:` with agent response
- [ ] Console shows: `üîä Audio delta received:` with sample counts
- [ ] Audio plays through speakers with OpenAI voice ("alloy")
- [ ] Speech is clear and natural

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå No audio playback
- ‚ùå Console shows: `üîä playNextAudio: Skipping - queueLength: 0`
- ‚ùå AudioContext suspended or failed to initialize

---

### Test 6: Complex Query (Token Limit Validation)
**Expected Behavior**: Complex queries should return full responses

**Steps**:
1. Type in text input (or speak): **"Build a trading plan for this week"**
2. Wait for agent response

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Response includes multiple sections:
  - Market analysis
  - Entry points
  - Stop loss levels
  - Profit targets
  - Risk management
- [ ] Response NOT truncated
- [ ] Response length > 500 characters

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå Response ends abruptly mid-sentence
- ‚ùå Missing sections (e.g., no risk management)
- ‚ùå Response: `I couldn't generate a response`

---

### Test 7: Turn-Taking and Interruption
**Expected Behavior**: User can interrupt AI speech, AI waits for user to finish

**Steps**:
1. Ask a question that generates long response
2. While AI is speaking, start speaking again
3. Check console

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Console shows: `üõë Cancelled active response:` (if AI was speaking)
- [ ] New user transcript starts immediately
- [ ] No overlapping speech

**Failure Indicators**:
- ‚ùå AI continues speaking over user
- ‚ùå Console error: `response_cancel_not_active`
- ‚ùå User speech not recognized during AI playback

## Console Event Flow Reference

### Correct Flow (Passive Mode with User Query)
```
‚úÖ GA-compliant session configured: PASSIVE voice I/O (turn_detection: none)
üé§ Sending <N> audio samples to OpenAI Realtime API
üìù [USER STT] New user speech started - ID: msg_abc123
üìù [USER STT] Transcript: "what is the price of Tesla"
‚úÖ [FINAL] User speech completed, emitting final transcript: what is the price of Tesla
‚úÖ [AGENT VOICE] Sending to agent: what is the price of Tesla
üìä [AGENT] Calling tool: get_stock_price
‚úÖ [AGENT] Tool result: {"symbol": "TSLA", "price": 234.56, ...}
ü§ñ [AGENT] Generated response: Tesla is currently trading at $234.56...
üì§ Sending text for TTS: Tesla is currently trading at $234.56...
üîä Audio delta received: 4800 samples
üîä playNextAudio: Starting playback
```

### Incorrect Flow (Autonomous Mode - Should NOT happen)
```
‚ùå response.audio_transcript.delta {"transcript": "Hello! How can I help..."}
‚ùå OpenAI generating autonomous responses
```

## Known Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: Autonomous Responses
**Symptom**: AI speaks immediately after connection without user input
**Cause**: `turn_detection` not set to "none" or conversational instructions
**Fix Applied**: `turn_detection: {type: "none"}` + passive instructions
**Validation**: No `response.audio_transcript.delta` events in console

### Issue 2: Microphone Not Requested
**Symptom**: Connection shows "connected" but no permission prompt
**Cause**: Missing `useOpenAIAudioProcessor` integration
**Fix Applied**: Added microphone setup in `useAgentVoiceConversation.ts`
**Validation**: Browser permission prompt appears

### Issue 3: Token Limit Truncation
**Symptom**: Complex responses cut off mid-sentence
**Cause**: max_tokens too low (was 800)
**Fix Applied**: Increased to 1500 for complex queries
**Validation**: Full responses for "build a trading plan" queries

### Issue 4: Response Cancel Errors
**Symptom**: Console shows `response_cancel_not_active` errors
**Cause**: Trying to cancel non-response items or inactive responses
**Fix Applied**: Type guard checking `item.type === 'response'`
**Validation**: No cancel errors in console

## Browser Console Commands

### Check OpenAI Connection Status
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log("Connected:", window.realtimeService?.isConnected());
console.log("Recording:", window.audioProcessor?.isRecording);
```

### Force Hard Refresh
```
Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Firefox: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Safari: Cmd+Option+R (Mac)
```

### Check AudioContext State
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log("AudioContext state:", window.audioContext?.state);
```

## Environment Variables to Verify

### Backend (.env)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Required for Realtime API
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Required for agent
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...  # Optional (agent uses OpenAI voice)
```

### Frontend (.env.development)
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Must match backend port
```
