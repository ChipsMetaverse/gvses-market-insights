# Computer Use Panel Location Fix

## The Problem

You asked: **"Is it using the right panel to query? I didn't notice it actually using the application"**

You were right to be concerned! Computer Use was looking in the WRONG location for the input field.

## The Issue

### ❌ WRONG Location (What Computer Use was trying)
- Looking for "query input" in the **Market Insights panel** (LEFT side)
- This panel doesn't exist anymore - it was replaced with compact ticker cards in the header

### ✅ CORRECT Location (Where it actually is)
- The text input is in the **Voice Assistant panel** (RIGHT side)
- Class: `voice-text-input`
- Placeholder: "Type a message..."
- Location: Bottom of the right panel

## The Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     HEADER (with tickers)                │
├──────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────────┤
│              │                    │                      │
│   CHART      │                    │    VOICE            │
│   ANALYSIS   │     TRADING        │    ASSISTANT        │
│   (LEFT)     │     CHART          │    (RIGHT)          │
│              │     (CENTER)       │                      │
│   - News     │                    │   - Messages         │
│   - Levels   │                    │   - TEXT INPUT ← HERE│
│              │                    │                      │
└──────────────┴────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated all test scenarios** to look for input in the Voice Assistant panel (right side)
2. **Modified prompts** to explicitly mention:
   - "Voice Assistant panel on the RIGHT side"
   - "text input field at the bottom"
   - "placeholder 'Type a message...'"

## The Model Computer Use is Using

**Yes, Computer Use is using a model:**
- Model: `computer-use-preview` (from OpenAI)
- Function: Analyzes screenshots and returns actions (click, type, scroll)
- Response format: `computer_call` items with action details

## Why It Wasn't Working

1. **Wrong Instructions**: Tests were telling Computer Use to look for a non-existent "Market Insights" query input
2. **UI Changes**: The app layout has evolved, but test scenarios weren't updated
3. **Panel Confusion**: Three panels exist, but Computer Use was searching in the wrong one

## How to Test the Fix

```bash
# Test with correct panel location
cd backend
USE_COMPUTER_USE=true python3 test_correct_panel.py

# Or test panel identification
USE_COMPUTER_USE=true python3 test_find_panels.py

# Run trader scenarios with fixed locations
USE_COMPUTER_USE=true python3 test_trader_scenarios.py --morning
```

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: All scenarios now correctly reference the Voice Assistant panel
✅ **Updated**: Trader persona prompts include correct panel locations
⚠️ **Testing Needed**: Computer Use should now find and use the input field correctly

## The Key Change

**Before:**
```python
"Type 'What is PLTR?' in the query input and submit"
```

**After:**
```python
"Find the Voice Assistant panel on the RIGHT side and click the text input field at the bottom"
"Type 'What is PLTR?' in the input field and press Enter"
```

## Summary

You were correct - Computer Use wasn't actually using the application properly because it was looking for the input field in the wrong place. The input is in the **RIGHT panel (Voice Assistant)**, not the left panel. All test scenarios have been updated to use the correct location.
