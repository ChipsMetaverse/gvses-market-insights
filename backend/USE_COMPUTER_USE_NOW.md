I need you to test a trading application using the browser. Here are the steps:

2. Open Firefox browser by clicking on its icon
3. In the Firefox address bar, type: http://host.docker.internal:5174
4. Press Enter and wait for the page to load (about 5 seconds)
5. You should see a trading dashboard with charts
6. Look for a text input field on the right side that says "Connect to send messages"
7. Click on that input field
8. Type exactly: Show me TSLA patterns
9. Press the Enter key to submit
10. Wait 3 seconds then take another screenshot
11. Tell me what you observed, including:
    - The current TSLA price
    - Any technical levels shown
    - Whether any patterns were detected
    - What appeared in the message area
```

### Step 3: Paste and Watch

3. **WATCH** the RIGHT panel as Computer Use:
   - Opens Firefox
   - Types the URL
   - Navigates to your app
   - Clicks on elements
   - Types messages
   - Takes screenshots
   - Reports what it sees

## üé¨ What You'll See

- Final report of what it found

### In the RIGHT Panel (Desktop):
