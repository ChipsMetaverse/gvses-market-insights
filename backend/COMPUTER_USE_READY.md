# Computer Use - Ready for Autonomous Testing! ✅

## All Issues Resolved

The Vite configuration has been updated to allow `host.docker.internal`, so Computer Use can now access your trading application from within the Docker container.

## How to Test Computer Use NOW

### 1. Go to Computer Use Interface
Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser (should already be open)

### 2. Paste This Command in the Chat Panel

```
Please help me test the Voice Assistant feature of the trading application:

1. Open Firefox browser in the desktop
2. Navigate to http://host.docker.internal:5174
3. Wait for the trading application to fully load
4. Look for the Voice Assistant panel on the RIGHT side of the page
5. Click on the text input field (placeholder: "Type a message...")
6. Type: "What is the current price of PLTR?"
7. Press Enter to submit
8. Wait for the response to appear
9. Report what information was provided about PLTR

As G'sves, the professional trader with 30+ years of experience,

```

### 3. Watch Computer Use Work Autonomously

You will see in real-time:
- Firefox opening in the virtual desktop (right panel)
- Automatic navigation to your trading app
- Mouse moving to the Voice Assistant input
- Text being typed character by character
- Enter key being pressed
- Response appearing in the Voice Assistant panel

### 4. Monitor with Playwright (Optional)

Run the Playwright monitoring script to programmatically control Computer Use:

```bash
cd backend && python3 playwright_control_computer_use.py
```

This will:
- Open a browser window showing Computer Use interface
- Automatically send the test command
- Monitor Computer Use's actions for 2 minutes
- Take screenshots of the results

## What's Fixed

✅ **Vite Configuration**: Added `host.docker.internal` to allowedHosts
✅ **Docker Networking**: Computer Use can now reach the host machine
✅ **Frontend Restarted**: Running with updated configuration
✅ **Playwright Script**: Ready to monitor Computer Use actions

## Current Status

- **Computer Use Docker**: ✅ Running on port 8080
- **Trading App Frontend**: ✅ Running on port 5174 (accessible via host.docker.internal)
- **Backend API**: ✅ Running on port 8000
- **Configuration**: ✅ Updated and applied

## Success Indicators

When Computer Use successfully completes the task, you'll see:
1. Firefox navigates to the trading app
2. The Voice Assistant input field is clicked
3. "What is the current price of PLTR?" is typed
4. A response appears with PLTR's current price and market data
5. Claude provides professional trading insights about PLTR

## Troubleshooting

If Computer Use can't access the app:
- Verify frontend is running: `curl http://localhost:5174`
- Check Docker container: `docker ps | grep computer-use`
- Restart frontend if needed: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

## Next Steps

After successful testing, you can:
1. Try more complex voice commands
2. Test chart interactions
3. Have Computer Use analyze technical indicators
4. Test multi-step trading workflows

The system is now fully configured for autonomous Computer Use interaction with your trading application!
