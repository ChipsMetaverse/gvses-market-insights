Page 2,"Factors that can be included while determining day trading crypto strategies: #1 Volume By trading volume, you can understand th e popularity of particul ar crypto ,  and the amoun t of activity tha t happens around tha t coin o r token.  A cryptocurrency mus t have considerable volume for day trading.  A good trading volume is an indication o f a healthy investment.  Cryptocurrency trading volume is determined by the numbe r of trades.  The higher the number of trades, the better the volume. #2 Volatility Volatility refers to the price fluctuation , that is predominan t in the cryptocurrency marke t which means  the digital asse t can be eithe r a success or a failure fo r the trader.  For day trading , one should choose a cryptocurrency with upward price volatility  so that you can mak e a profi t as an d whe n it spikes. It is not  unusual for a coin price to fluctuate by 10-50% in a day. #3 Cryptocurrency Exchanges You must remembe r that the crypto you choose mus t be supported by the reputable exchanges. Mostly the day traders store thei r asse t in cryptocurrency exchanges which is quite risky,  so the security is high.  You must look out for the number of coins listed on the exchange along with transparency and transaction fees. #4 Recent News News can affec t any industry and i f it's good, the prices migh t rise and vice versa.  Cryptocurrency industry is sensitiv e to negativ e news as it is no t regulated , unlik e fiat currencies.  Popularity and impressions play an importan t role in the cryptocurrency industry as its being managed  by people all across the world. #5 Active Team For any crypto projec t success , you must see how active the team is!  The more they are active , the more promp t they can be in answering you r queries. A strong and active team is helpful as they send regula r updates regarding the particula r token or coin.Invest in Yourself Before You Invest in the Market   Understanding and using Risk Management  and Position Sizing is literally the most important thing you can do to improve your trading! When considering any trade, you need to know three different prices:  •  Your Entry Price (the price you buy at) •  Your Stop Loss Price (the price where you exit an unsuccessful trade) •  Your Take Profit Price (your target price where you will close the trade) Managing risk:   your potential loss (or Risk) is limited to an amount that you determine in advance.  The suggested Risk is 1% of trading capital per trade.  Using a 1% Risk level protects your capital when you eventually run into a string of losing trades. If you lose on 5 consecutive trades, you’ve only lost 5% of your capital,  which can be recovered quickly.  New traders and those with a smaller amount of trading capital may be better off risking only 0.5% at first,  while more experienced traders may risk as much as 3%.  Anything greater than 3% Risk is not recommended.  You manage Risk by using a Stop Loss order.  The potential loss in a trade is determined by the difference between your Entry Price and  your Stop Loss Price.  The Stop Loss order limits your loss to whatever amount you already determined as your acceptable Risk (1% of  your trading capital, for example).  The level for your Stop Loss should always be derived from a proper analysis, and not by picking an arbitrary  number.  A Stop Loss order is designed to get you out of a bad trade with minimal loss of capital.  Do not get discouraged if your Stop Loss gets hit! Its part of the plan, its expected and normal to get stopped out  of a trade. •We suggest that you do not enter more than 2 or 3 trades at a time. It can be difficult to effectively manage more than 3 trades at once.Watch the Videos and Take Notes click here"

The Order Book shows you the number of coins or tokens being offered at each price – this is also known as ‘market depth ’.  Buy orders are know n as ‘Bids’ , since you are bidding a price to buy an asset from someone.

Page 11,"We estimate where price might go from the breakout zone within a time frame from several  days. That way we get our risk to reward ratio –which may just be a theoretical ratio based  on your estimations, but still it‘s important to estimate it as it tells you why you make the  trade and if it‘s worth the try. Rather than having now clue, with no analysis in advance and  randomly buy and wait like a gambler You can let the other half ride and see how high it goes. Here comes our stop loss again –as risk management.  We move it up above our entry, to a level where price is not allowed to fall back in order to hold the trend. Now you‘re safe and even in profit in any case. Let the winner ride and move up stop loss again:Not Taking Profit –The „Too High Expectations Trap” A huge beginners mistake is not to lock in profit when it‘s there because of greed: They have  certain expectations how high price should go because they compare the chart with others where  price had pumped in certain extreme highs. Trading with such a strong bias is dangerous: Newbies tend to wait way too long to take profit,  often till the top is past long ago and price is descending back. Many even watch price go all the way back to their entry till they get ourwith nothing. Or even  worse –they lose money in a trade where they could have had a great gain! But maybe „only“ 80%  instead of the 200% they had been dreaming of.. Profit is always better than no profit, right? Bitcointradingsites"

Page 13,"Knowing What Trading Is: Trading is when you first make a plan about your trade. So you answer all of these questions in advance: 1.What’s your goal (get more Bitcoin, more Ethereum, more USD?) 2.Why do you want to enter a trade –Which signals tell you that this price is going to go up (or down)? 3.How far do you expect price to move at least? 4.In which time frame do you expect price to move up (or down)? 5.Where would be your entry price? 6.Where would be your stop loss? 7.What’s your hedging strategy? 8.Where do you take profit?With these parameters you are able to execute a trade, from the beginning to the end.  Otherwise you don’t know what you are doing and probably end up with noprofit or even a loss. Knowing What Trading Is Not: Just buying somewhere, where price looks relatively low, without precise entry plan would be investing and not  trading. Investments should be done based on fundamentals:  You should know exactly why you expect a cryptocurrency to gain value over time and why it shouldn‘t just disappear  at some point. Keep in mind that there is a big competition between those hundreds of altcoins which are just slightly adjusted  clones of each other in many cases, or at least very similar concepts. Most likely few of them will survive in the longrun . So investing without an idea IF, WHY and WHEN this thing is  going to pump, is not a smart investment strategy."

Page 44,"Finding Fibonacci Retracement Levels Traders use the Fibonacci retracement levels as potential support and resistance areas . Since so many traders watch these same levels and place buy and sell orders on them to enter trades or place  stops, the support and resistance levels tend to become a self -fulfilling prophecy. The idea is to go long (or buy) on a retracement at a Fibonacci support level when the market is trending up, and to  go short (or sell) on a retracement at a Fibonacci resistance level when the market is trending down. In order to find these Fibonacci retracement levels, you have to find the recent significant Swing Highs and Swings  Lows. For downtrends, click on the Swing High and drag the cursor to the most recent Swing Low. For uptrends, do the opposite. Click on the Swing Low and drag the cursor to the most recent Swing High. Uptrend Now, let’s look at what happened after the Swing High occurred.Downtrend Let’s take a look at what happened next. That’s why you need to hone your skills and combine the Fibonacci retracement tool with other tools in your forex  toolbox to help give you a higher probability of success.While Fibonacci retracement levels give you a higher probability of success, like other  technical tools, they don’t always work. You don’t know if price will reverse to the (x)% level  before resuming the trend.Fibonacci retracements do NOT always work! They are not foolproof. A A A AB BB BClick here for video"

Page 47,"How to Use Fibonacci Extensions to Know When to Take Profit In an uptrend , the general idea is to take profits on a long trade at a Fibonacci Price Extension Level. You determine the Fibonacci extension levels by using three mouse clicks . First, click on a significant Swing Low, then drag your cursor and click on the most recent Swing High. Finally, drag your  cursor back down and click on any of the retracement levels. AB C The 50.0% Fib level held strongly as support and, after three tests, the pair finally resumed its uptrend.
