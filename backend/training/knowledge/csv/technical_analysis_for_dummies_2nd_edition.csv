"Dedication"
"This book is dedicated to Robert James Deadman, founder of Technical"
"Systems Analysis Group, who taught as much of “the scientific way of thinking”"
"as it’s possible to cram into a “social science” mind, and with endless patience."
""
"I also dedicate the book to Alfred A. “Chip” Olbrycht, who forces me to question"
"the easy way and to look at everything a second time, and a third time, too."

"Author’s Acknowledgments"
"For Dummies editors Mike Baker and Alissa Schwipps, who caused much"
"suffering. I’m wrung-out, but you, dear reader, have a better book."
""
"And the usual suspects: Jim Sullivan, head of the Fairfield County Technical"
"Traders’ Club, contributed numerous gentle nudges on perspective as well"
"as how traders really use indicators and think about trading risk. Ed Dobson,"
"founder of Traders Press, and Perry Kaufman, author of Trading Systems and"
"Methods, always generous. Most generous of all over the years is Desmond"

"Every author must make assumptions about her audience, and I’ve made a"
"few assumptions that may apply to you:"

"✓ You’ve never put a dime into a security but you plan to; and when you"
"do, you intend not to lose it."
"✓ You’re reasonably well versed in the trading game, but you’re looking for"
"new tools to become a more effective trader and improve your profits."
"✓ You’re tired of the buy-and-hold approach in which your returns seem"
"unrelated to the supposed quality of the security you bought."
"✓ You want to find out how to sell. You know how to buy, but timing your"
"sales ties you up in knots."

"How This Book Is Organized"
"I’ve arranged Technical Analysis For Dummies into six parts. Parts I and II"
"introduce you to the field of technical analysis, and Parts III through V intro-"
"duce you to nuts and bolts — the indicators. What’s that leave? The famous"
"For Dummies Part of Tens — Part VI."
""
""
""
"Part I: Defining Technical Analysis"
"The point of technical analysis is to help you observe prices in a new way"
"and to make trading decisions based on reasonable expectations about"
"where “the market” is going to take the price. This part shows you how to"
"view security prices as the outcome of crowd psychology."
""
""
""
"Part II: Preparing Your Mind"
"for Technical Analysis"
"Before you plunge into risking hard-earned cash on securities trading, you have"
"to realize that it’s not the security that counts; it’s the trade. Each trade has two"
"parts — the price analysis and you. Price analysis tools are called indicators, and"
"you have to select the indicators that match your personality and preference"
"for risk. But most people don’t know their risk preference when they start out"
"in securities trading (which changes over time, anyway), so you have a chicken-"
"and-egg situation. By studying the kinds of profit and loss outcomes that each"
"type of indicator delivers, you can figure out your risk preferences."
""
""
""
"Part III: Observing Market Behavior"
"The price bar and its placement on the chart deliver a ton of information"
"about market sentiment. It doesn’t take much practice to start reading the"
"mind of the market by looking at bars and small patterns. The payoff is cold,"
"hard cash, but you have to be patient, imaginative, and thoughtful."

"Taking a Closer Look at the Many"
"Faces of Trendedness"
"Trend means different things to different people. Trend is such a wide and"
"flexible concept that a large variety of definitions is possible. In fact, to be"
"pragmatic, you can say that a trend is a price move that your indicator identi-"
"fies. In other words, you can define trend according to technical measures"
"that appeal to your sense of logic and what works for you. In this book, defi-"
"nitions of trendedness are spread out under various technique headings so"
"that you can choose which definition of trendedness suits your personality"
"and trading style."
""
""
""
"Quantifying trendedness"
"Creating a chart like the one in Figure 1-1 is easy. To illustrate classic trend"
"behavior, I could’ve taken any security out of thousands in my database and"
"found some period of time over which the security’s price looked like this"
"chart. However, I could have also found many time periods when this same"
"security was not trending. In fact, some securities are frequently in a trend-"
"ing mode, others seldom trend, or their trends are short lived. To complicate"
"matters, some securities exhibit a “habit” of tidy trending while others trend"
"in a sloppy way (with high variability around the average)."
""
"Charles Dow may have started the ball rolling in technical analysis over 100"
"years ago, but in the grand scheme of things, we’re still in frontier days. Ask"
"a group of technical traders, “What percentage of time are securities trend-"
"ing and what percentage of the time are they nontrending?” and you will get"
"a different answer from each person. Each technical analyst has a different"
"idea about the percentage of time securities are trending based on his own"
"personal definition of trendedness and the time frame he looks at."
""
"Choosing a definition"
"No single definition of trendedness is the universal gold standard on which"
"everyone agrees, so it’s hardly surprising that no one can say, “Securities are"
"trended x percent of the time.” Just about any generalization about trended-"
"ness can be demonstrated — or rebutted."
""
"For example, I trade foreign exchange, and in my experience, the pound, the"
"euro, and the yen are trended about 60 percent of the time. I say that because"
"60 percent of the time, I can identify a directional bias by using my tools on"
"my time frames. However, someone else may say currencies are trended only"

"Technical analysis"
"Technical analysis is the broadest of the terms. It covers hand-drawn lines"
"as well as grand theories of price cycles. In short, technical analysis is a term"
"encompassing all the tricks and techniques."
""
"Technical analysis is not confined to just math-based techniques, as some"
"folks may think. Using math is a breakthrough and a curse. Math may out-"
"perform human judgment and the human eye, as many an optical illusion"
"has proved, but it’s not true that numbers never lie. Numbers lie all the time"
"in price analysis! You can have a textbook-perfect trend with ten confirming"
"indicators, and it can still run into a brick wall — really bad news that trashes"
"the price of the security. Math can never overcome the inconvenient fact that"
"fresh news, which no one can predict, may overwhelm any price trend."

"Securities aren’t socks: The demand effect"
"Securities are different from cars, bread, and socks. You don’t buy a security"
"for the joy of owning it and using it. You can’t drive it, eat it, or wear it. Aside"
"from getting a dividend or coupon payment, the only reason to buy a security"
"is to sell it again, preferably for more than you paid for it. Unless you’re a"
"merchant, you hardly ever buy anything with the idea of selling it again —"
"except securities."
""
"In standard economic thinking, the law of supply and demand states that"
"demand for an item depends on its price, which is a function of scarcity. If"
"something is rare, it’s expensive. At higher and higher prices, demand falls"
"off. At some point, the high price induces suppliers to produce more of the"
"thing, whereupon the price falls. Equilibrium consists of demanders and sup-"
"pliers finding the mix of quantity and price that both parties find acceptable."
"This process is called price discovery, and it can take time."
""
"In contrast, in securities trading, the pricing process is like the pricing pro-"
"cess in an auction. For one thing, prices move a lot faster. Plus, in an auction"
"(such as the online auctioneer eBay), demand for the item often rises as the"
"price rises. If you ever participated in an auction, you probably paid more for"
"something than you should have. But you just couldn’t let the other guy win,"
"right? Every time someone else outbids you, you want the item more than"
"ever and become determined to be the winner. The intrinsic value of the item"
"doesn’t matter. Sound familiar? You may even have an object or two in the"
"hall closet you’re ashamed of having bought at an auction. I certainly do."
""
"In an auction (whether live or online), what gets your blood running is that"
"someone else also wants to buy the item in question. Visible demand begets"
"more demand. Auction economics are contrary to what traditional econom-"
"ics teaches — that demand will decrease as the price rises. In the auction"
"situation, demand increases as the price rises. The item may or may not be"
"actually scarce in the real world. It doesn’t matter."
""
"The immediacy of the auction is what skews prices, sometimes to absurd"
"levels. Later, when suppliers see the high prices, they may indeed be able"
"to find or produce more of the item — but by then, the specific demand"
"dynamic of that one auction is gone."
""
""
""
"Creating demand from scratch"
"When you are wearing your investor hat, you may buy stocks and bonds"
"chiefly to get the dividend or the interest rate coupon, with capital gain on"
"the price a secondary consideration. When you are wearing your trader hat,"
"you buy a security because you think the price will rise. You decide to sell"
"because you have a profit that meets your needs or because you have taken"
"an intolerable loss. You seldom think about the true supply of the security."

"Does this sound too good to be true? Well, it is. Mean-reversion trading"
"ideas have the appearance of applying basic statistical concepts to securi-"
"ties prices to derive trading rules, but mean-reversion trading faces severe"
"obstacles, such as:"
""
"✓ What is the ideal lookback period to determine the average? Say, for"
"example, that Blue Widget stock over the past two years averaged $20 —"
"but that $20 average incorporates a few abnormal prices like $1 and $40."
"An average can disguise multiple deviations that have already occurred."
"✓ Is it true that securities prices are normally distributed? Statisticians"
"say that securities prices are not actually normally distributed — they"
"just look that way sometimes. In technical analysis, your primary goal"
"is to determine whether your security exhibits a price trend. You also"
"want to know how strong the trend is and whether it might be ending"
"soon. To accept the assumption that the distribution of prices will be"
"normal is the same thing as saying that you know in advance where the"
"price trend will end — at or near the price represented by the average"
"plus one standard deviation. If the price goes higher than the price that"
"one standard deviation dictates, the trading rule embedded in the mean-"
"reversion trading technique would have you sell."
"You consider the security “overpriced” on a statistical basis. And yet"
"you can’t be sure that the other traders in the market performed exactly"
"the same analysis as you did. Even if they are using the mean-reversion"
"concept, maybe they used a different lookback period to calculate the"
"average. Because the other traders in this security don’t see the security"
"as overpriced, they may keep buying, and buying, and buying — push-"
"ing the price to the equivalent of the guy in the room standing 7 feet 10"
"inches. The opposite is true, too. The mean-reversion process would not"
"identify the situation where the price keeps going to zero."
""
""
""
""
"Identifying and Responding"
"to Crowd Extremes"
"Statistical analysis cannot capture the nuances of crowd behavior. One way to"
"get a handle on crowd behavior is to master the key terms referring to crowd"
"behavior. These terms range from general trading-lore descriptions to words"
"that are specific to technical analysis. Notice that most of the lingo applies to"
"crowd extremes. These words and phrases, whether old news or brand-new to"
"you, are important as you navigate the technical trading waters."

"Truth to tell, though, no indicator works all the time, and this one doesn’t,"
"either. The OBV indicator didn’t forecast Pivot Day 2 on Figure 3-1, although"
"it did fall right afterward. Therefore, you’d have to say it was not leading this"
"time, but rather coincidental. Even OBV inventor Granville famously missed"
"a major bull market that started in 1982, and then persisted in saying it was"
"a false bull for the next 14 years. However, OBV correctly predicted the"
"crash of October, 1987 — in August, two months early. So you can see that"
"Granville’s personal woes with forecasting do not detract from the usefulness"
"of his indicator, even if it can be tricky to apply."
""
""
""
"Refining volume indicators"
"As noted in the section “Tracking on-balance volume” earlier in the chapter,"
"the OBV indicator attributes all the day’s volume to buying. This is not realis-"
"tic. It makes more sense to attribute only a portion of the volume to the price"
"rise, rather than the whole kit and caboodle."
""
"A technical analyst named Marc Chaikin figured that a more representative"
"amount would be the percentage equivalent of the price that is above the"
"midpoint of the day. You calculate a midpoint as the high of the day plus the"
"low of the day divided by two. Chaikin’s version of accumulation and distri-"
"bution is more refined than OBV."
""
"If a security closes above its daily midpoint, bullish sentiment ruled. The"
"close over the midpoint defines accumulation, referring to buyers being will-"
"ing to pay higher prices to get sellers to part with the security. The closer the"
"closing price is to the high, the more bullish it was. If the price closed right"
"at the high, then you say that 100 percent of the volume can be attributed to"
"bullish sentiment."
""
"Conversely, distribution is the term for sellers willing to accept lower prices"
"in order to induce buyers to buy. Lower prices imply bearish sentiment."
"Distribution is calculated the same way as accumulation — a close below the"
"price midpoint means distribution. The closer the closing price is to the low,"
"the more distribution existed. If the close is exactly at the midpoint, then the"
"indicator has the same value as yesterday — and you have no reason to add"

"track the breadth indicators to get a feel for market sentiment."
""
"Breadth indicators include"
""
"✓ Ratio of advancing to declining issues: This indicator measures the"
"mood of the market. Stocks that are reaching a higher price today than"
"yesterday are called advancing issues. Stocks that are reaching lower"
"prices are called declining issues. When advancers outnumber decliners,"
"money is flowing into the market. Bulls are beating bears. Sentiment is"
"favorable. When the rally starts getting tired, the number of advancing"
"issues declines while the number of falling issues rises."
"If you subtract declining issues from advancing ones, you get the"
"advance/decline line. In the same vein, if you divide advancing issues by"
"declining issues, you get the advance/decline ratio, abbreviated A/D."
"✓ Difference between issues making new highs and new lows: The logic"
"is the same as in the advance/decline indicator. If more stocks in an"
"index are closing at higher prices than the period before, bullishness"
"is on the rise. When a higher number are putting in new lows, supply is"
"overwhelming demand and the mood must be bearish."
""
"Following the betting: Options"
"The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is the venue for options trad-"
"ing in equity indices like the S&P and NASDAQ indices. The CBOE publishes"
"the ratio of puts to calls. Here’s what you need to know about puts and calls"
"when gathering info about sentiment:"
""
"✓ Put: This term refers to the right to sell at a set price in the future."
"Traders who buy puts are bears (pessimists) who think the index won’t"
"reach their set price."
"✓ Call: A call is the right to buy at a set price in the future. Traders who"
"buy calls are bulls (optimists) who think they’ll profit when the market"
"rises to and beyond their set price."
""
"Accordingly, the put/call ratio is an indicator of whether sentiment is bear-"
"ish or bullish. A high put/call ratio means bears are winning. Recognize that"
"an extreme of emotion like this is usually wrong, and marks a turning point."
"You should start planning to do the opposite. The same line of thinking holds"
"true for a low put/call ratio: When emotions are running strongly optimistic,"
"watch out for an opportunity to take advantage of a change."

""
"Enduring randomness"
"Technical traders acknowledge that random events can and do cause the"
"occasional wild price departure from the norm, but the acknowledgement"
"doesn’t alter the expectation that prices will behave normally. For example,"
"you sometimes see a price spike so big that you don’t know how to interpret"
"it (as you can see in Chapter 7). Often you never find out why such a bizarre"
"price occurred."
""
"A price spike is the equivalent of a tornado in weather forecasting. You know"
"the conditions that cause tornadoes — you just don’t know exactly when an"
"actual tornado will develop."
""
"Although nature may not be able to deliver a tornado in Alaska in January,"
"the equivalent does happen in markets. Sudden cataclysmic events aren’t as"
"rare as you may imagine. Who would have thought that the S&P 500 could"
"fall more than 20 percent in a single day? Most market observers used to say"
"it was impossible. But that’s exactly what happened on Black Monday, 1987."
"Most market tornadoes, like Black Monday, give plenty of technical warnings"
"ahead of time. The problem is that traders often have those same warnings"
"and don’t get a Black Monday. This is an inconvenient fact of life that you"
"have to accept."
""
"Spikes are both a problem and an opportunity. If you know why a spike is"
"occurring because you are well informed about world events and market"
"chatter in response to the world events, you may chose to ride it out. But to"
"exit on fear of randomness is okay, too. You take no risk when you are out of"
"the market. Nowhere is it written that you must have a position in the market"
"at all times."
""
""
""
"Remembering the last price"
"Market panics and crashes on the scale of 1929, 1987, and 2000 are historic"
"events outside the purview of the crowd’s normal trading process. In normal"
"trading, you can assume that a wildly erratic price has a low probability of"
"occurring. But you can’t attach a specific probability statistic to an event of"
"historic proportions — partly because those events are so rare."
""
""
""
""
"www.it-ebooks.info"
"54   Part I: Defining Technical Analysis"
""
"In weather forecasting, a low-probability event (like a tornado) that happens"
"today doesn’t change the probabilities of the usual high-probability events"
"happening next week or next year. But in markets, a low-probability event"
"does change the odds for the next period analysis because traders remember."
""
"When you are performing technical analysis on your securities, you count on"
"traders to remember the last prices and to form their trading plans on those"
"prices. The next price is normally dependent on preceding prices, and most"
"technical analysis programs allow you to project out a trendline (like a linear"
"regression line, for example)."
""
"But one or two really big abnormal prices can sometimes upset the apple"
"cart and determining which way the crowd will jump is sometimes just a"
"coin toss. This analogy raises the issue of the reliability of indicators, which"
"I describe in Chapter 4. They’re essentially forecasting tools that depend on"
"past behaviors to predict future behaviors, but they often fail near really big"
"key reversals. Technical analysis is not science, as its inability to capture"
"historic key reversals ahead of time demonstrates. In other words, having the"
"best technical tools on the planet will not save you from a market tornado."
""
""
""
""
"Thinking Scientifically"
"Even the best indicator fails to work all the time. In fact, some of the best"
"indicators work less than 50 percent of the time, and that’s when conditions"
"are normal! Critics use this awful statistic to say that technical analysis is a"
"waste of time. This harsh opinion results from a failure to appreciate the ben-"
"efits of risk management embedded in the technical trading style."
""
"You may think that it’s overkill to discuss scientific method, but I can practi-"
"cally guarantee that this section will have a big payoff for you. That’s because"
"you’re sure to see enticing advertisements for software or trading programs"
"that are “scientific” and “objective.” Well, all math is “scientific” and “objec-"
"tive” — but that doesn’t mean you can use it to make money, and it certainly"
"doesn’t mean that using it will help you escape the next market tornado."
""
""
""
"Conditions and contingencies"
"When you hear someone say, “Blue Widget has a 75 percent chance of rising,”"
"you can assume that three out of the last four times the technical method was"
"applied, the security rose. The unspoken assumption is that conditions didn’t"
"change. But the market is not a laboratory. Of course conditions changed!"

"Your forecast needs to be qualified because of the thousands of factors that"
"may come along and influence the price. Contingencies are things that are"

"Your price data seldom presents you with 30 cases, let alone 200. Why"
"should you accept less? The answer is that you’re using a technical analysis"
"method that works across a wide range of securities and time frames, even if"
"you don’t have enough cases in this specific security."
""
"For example, when you have a support line (which I describe in Chapter 10)"
"and your price breaks it to the downside, that’s a sell signal. Over the past"
"100 years, technical analysts have used the break of a support line hundreds"
"of thousands of times, maybe millions, and it worked. Using this method was"
"the correct trading decision in the majority of a very large number of cases."
"Still, choosing to use the break of a support line as a signal doesn’t work"
"every time. A support line break is an example of a technical forecast that has"
"a high probability in the context of many different contingencies and over"
"many sets of conditions."
""
"Other techniques are less reliable. You may think it would be wonderful to"
"have a list of techniques with their reliability quotient, which is a ranking of"
"how often they’re right. Some writers and software vendors claim that their"
"techniques are “over 75 percent correct.” This lofty proclamation is hardly"
"ever true. For one thing, the vendors aren’t considering new contingencies"
"and conditions. Markets are dynamic. Something that worked 75 percent of"

"traders argue the merits and drawbacks of indicators in each situation, and"

"get ten entirely different lists. To a certain extent, the indicator you choose"
"for each task depends on the security and also on the analytical time frame."

"Choosing your trading style"
"Unless you’re trading setups, which I describe in Chapter 16, the trend is"
"always the focus. In a perfect world, you first determine whether your secu-"
"rity is trending or range-trading sideways, and then you apply the appropri-"
"ate indicator. In practice, you can’t always classify price moves as trending or"
"not trending in a neat and tidy way. Besides, prices usually have an identifi-"
"able range, whether they’re trending or not. In addition, retracements always"
"create doubt — you find yourself wondering, “Is it a momentary correction or"
"a reversal?”"
""
"Generally, traders tend to have one of the following two personal trading"
"styles and the style dictates the holding period:"
""
"✓ Trend-followers: Traders who like to identify trends may wait out"
"retracements and sideways range-trading situations until they resolve"
"back into a trend. Other trend followers use information from momen-"
"tum indicators to modify their positions, for instance by taking some"
"profit when the security becomes overbought or oversold even though"
"the trend is just pausing. They expect it to continue. (See Chapter 2 for"
"a definition of overbought and oversold and Chapter 13 for overbought"
"and oversold indicators.) Figure 4-1 illustrates a trend, complete with"
"minor retracements, and shows how a trend-following trader makes"
"decisions."
"✓ Swing traders: These folks operate whether a trend is present or not."
"Swing trading is buying at relative lows and selling at relative highs,"
"regardless of whether the price is trending. Swing trading is more flex-"
"ible than trend-following, because you can apply the techniques under"
"different market conditions. However, the drawback to swing trading is"
"that it requires more frequent trading and the profit on each leg of the"
"trade tends to be smaller than in a single trend-following trade."

"rules improve your trading performance by refining the buy/sell signals you"
"get from indicators. Trading rules tend to be more complex and contain more"
"conditions than raw indicators, such as “buy after the first 45 minutes if x and"
"y also occur” or “sell half the position when z occurs.”"

"✓ Which securities? This question is trickier. Again according to Tharp,"
"you can add up the R values for each of your securities and average"
"them, giving you the expected return. If you are not happy with this"
"number, you can alter the portfolio to include securities with a higher"
"or lower R to shift the average. Similarly, you can take the square root"
"of the mean R of the portfolio to measure its variance, and if that is a"
"number that is too high or low for you, you can alter the composition of"
"the portfolio."
"✓ How do you allocate your capital among the securities you’re trading?"
"You can divide it up equally, or you can allocate a higher percentage"
"to the security getting the most winning trades over the past 30, 60, or"
"90 days. You can also allocate according to the volatility of the security"
"(check out Chapter 14 for more on volatility)."
"Finally, you can apply fixed fractional position sizing, popularized by"
"Ralph Vince, which calls for allocation as a function of total possible loss"
"as a fixed percentage of total capital. Say you have $10,000 in capital and"
"you want to buy Blue Widget stock at $40 per share. You set your stop at"
"$2, meaning you will sell if it reaches $38. At the same time, you want to"
"limit the possible loss on Blue Widget to 2.5 percent of your total port-"
"folio, or $250. Therefore, you can buy no more than 6.3 shares of Blue"
"Widget."
"Buying only 6 shares (an odd-lot, where a standard lot is 100 shares)"
"can be done but at a high commission cost. You need to pick a lower-"
"priced stock, reduce your stop, or raise the percentage of your portfolio"
"dedicated to a single security. Even if you plan not to use fixed fractional"
"position sizing, remember that this example embodies the spirit of man-"

"Taking Money off the Table: Establishing"
"the Profit Target"
"When you have a gain in a trade, how much is enough? How do you know"
"when to take profits? Unfortunately, few gurus offer guidance on how to"
"design a take-profit rule. You never know at the beginning of a trend how long"
"it will last, or how far it will go. The central issue in managing the trade is that"
"you can have control over the size of your losses (via stop-losses), but very"
"little control over the size of the gains. You can buy a stock at $5 and make"
"sure that you only lose $2, but you cannot force the stock to go to $9."
""
"In practice, each individual trader develops his own technique that is a com-"
"bination of risk analysis and indicator readings. The optimum way to take"
"profit is, in fact, one of the great, unexplored frontiers of technical trading."
"Here are some choices for selecting a profit target:"
""
""
""
"www.it-ebooks.info"
"                                                   Chapter 5: Managing the Trade           79"
"✓ Name a dollar amount. Logically, you are compensated by an amount"
"that is a multiple of the risk you are taking. This is the Tharp approach I"
"mention in the section, “Common questions and concerns.” You set your"
"initial risk at $2 and are willing to accept a loss of a fraction of that, or"
"$1.50. Your profit target is double initial risk, or $4. Because the security"
"initially costs $8, you seek a 50 percent return. This expected gain may"
"or may not be realistic depending on your holding period, changes in"
"volatility, and other factors. After you have made the 50 percent, how-"
"ever, you obey the target and exit the trade when it reaches $12. The"
"problem with this approach, of course, is that the price may keep on"
"rising and then you have an opportunity loss if it reaches (say) $20."
"✓ Set a true-range amount. Your security, historically, has an average"
"high-low range of $10 over 20 periods, your expected holding period."
"You want to capture 75 percent of the range, or $7.50. Because you use"
"indicators to time your entry, you assume that you are entering at the"
"low end of the range; therefore, 75 percent is realistic. When the price"
"reaches your target, you take profit."
"The problem with this approach is twofold: The range can widen or"
"narrow. If it widens, you aimed too low and if it narrows, your original"
"target is too ambitious. Second, how do you sit through a pullback?"
"You may have met the goal of entering at a low only to have an aberrant"
"pullback take the price down 30 percent rather than up 75 percent. This"
"movement was not enough to hit your stop but now your profit target"
"is $10.50 away from the current price. Because you know the average"
"range is $10, the probability of meeting your $7.50 target within your"
"holding period just went out the window."
"✓ Rely on indicators. Instead of formulating take-profit rules, most techni-"
"cal traders rely on indicators to signal when a move has ended — the"
"signal is the de facto take-profit rule. Relying on indicators is “winging"
"it” and actually requires more market monitoring than the fixed dollar"
"amount or average true-range methods, which deliver a number you can"
"convert into a standing order with your broker."
""
""
""
""
"Controlling Losses"
"Your level of risk seeking or risk aversion is personal. Therefore, nobody can"
"design rules for you. You must do it for yourself. Ask yourself whether you’d"
"faithfully follow every buy/sell signal generated by a given indicator when the"
"backtest of the indicator predicts that you will have some individual trades"
"that entail a loss of 50 percent of your trading capital. No?"
""
"Well, how much of your trading capital are you prepared to lose? This is not an"
"idle question. Your answer is critical to whether you succeed in technical trad-"
"ing. If you say you can accept no losses at all, forget technical trading. You will"
"take losses in technical trading. If you say that you’re willing to lose 50 percent"

"should turn profitable right away if you’ve done the analysis right and"
"you’re actually buying right after a low or selling right after a peak. If"
"the price first rises for a day or two but can’t hold on to the gain, the up"
"move that you think you’ve identified is probably a false one. Consider"
"the crowd dynamics (see Chapter 2) and how they play out on the price"
"bar (covered in Chapter 6). You need a series of higher highs and higher"
"lows to name an uptrend. If you get a lower low in the first three days,"
"the probability is good that the trade is going south."
"✓ Pattern stops: Pattern stops relate directly to market sentiment and are"
"very handy. Most are of the fixed variety. I list a few below:"
"• The break of a support or resistance line is a powerful stop level,"
"chiefly because so many other traders are drawing the same lines."
"• The last notable high or low (the historic level; see Chapter 4) or"
"the high or low of an important time period, like a year, are note-"
"worthy."
"• You can infer stops from other pattern indicators, such as the"
"center confirmation point of the W in a double bottom or the M"
"in a double top (see Chapter 9). When the confirmation point is"
"surpassed, the probability is high that the move continues in the"
"expected direction. If you’re positioned the wrong way when the"
"pattern appears, the pattern confirmation is also your stop level."
"✓ Moving-average stop: You can also use a separate indicator that isn’t"
"part of your buy/sell repertoire to set a stop, such as a moving average"
"(see Chapter 12). You may not use a moving average because of its lag-"
"ging nature, but many traders use a breakout beyond the 10-day moving"
"average as a warning to reduce a position, and the 20-day moving aver-"
"age as a stop. You may find it interesting how often a retracement will"
"penetrate a 10-day moving average but halt just short of crossing the"
"20-day moving average. A moving-average stop is clearly of the self-"
"adjusting variety."
""
"Volatility stops are the most complex of the indicator-based, self-adjusting"
"stops to figure out and to apply, but they’re also the most in tune with market"
"action. Many variations are available. Here are three of particular interest:"

"✓ Parabolic stop-and-reverse model: Invented by Welles Wilder, the para-"
"bolic concept is easy to illustrate and hard to describe. The principle"
"is to create an indicator that rises by a factor of the average true range"
"(see Chapter 7) as new highs are being recorded, so that the indicator"
"accelerates as ever-higher highs are met and decelerates as less-high"
"highs come in. In an uptrend, the indicator is plotted just below the"
"price line. It diverges from the price line in a hot rally, and converges to"
"the price line as the rally loses speed. See Figure 5-1. The parabolic stop"
"is both self-adjusting and trailing — a rare combination."

"Time stops"
"Time stops acknowledge that money tied up in a trade that’s going nowhere"
"can be put to better use in a different trade. Say you’re holding a position that"
"starts going sideways. It is reasonable to exit the trade and find a different"
"security that is moving. Remember, the purpose of trading is to make money."
""
"Clock and calendar stops"
"Clock and calendar stops pertain to a price event happening (or not happen-"
"ing) considering the time of day, week, month, or year. Clock-based rules"
"abound. Some technical traders advise against trading during the first hour in"
"the U.S. stock market, because buy- or sell-on-open orders are being executed"
"then (see Chapter 6). Others say that more gain can be had from the first"
"hour than any other hour of the trading day if you can figure out which way"
"the crowd is trading. As I describe in Chapter 16, one setup technique is to"
"buy or sell the direction of an opening gap — and be done in an hour."
""
"In foreign exchange, you often see prices retrace at the end of the European"
"trading day — about 11 a.m. in New York — as traders there close positions."
"Not only is this a swell entry place when you’re sure that you know the trend,"
"but it’s also a benchmark for the U.S. trading day. If the price fails to close"
"higher or lower than the European close, it means that American traders are"
"having second thoughts about the trend."
""

""
"Adjusting Positions"
"Stops are the first line of defense against indicator failures and market catas-"
"trophes. But to exit a position is an extreme response when your uncertainty"
"isn’t high. A stop is a blunt instrument when more delicacy may be called for."
"(For more on stops, see the earlier section, “Using the First Line of Defense:"
"Stop-Loss Orders.”)"
""
"Most indicators are black and white. You should either buy or sell. They lack"
"nuance. Similarly, stops are a one-way proposition. But often when you’re"
"using multiple indicators, you don’t get a clear-cut trading decision, or as the"
"trade progresses, one of your confirming indicators weakens and is no longer"
"offering the comfort of full confirmation. Perhaps a pattern spells doom to"
"your position. You don’t use patterns and perhaps you don’t like patterns,"
"but it’s a nagging worry."
""
"Another reason to adjust positions gradually instead of betting the ranch"
"on day one is to follow the confirmation principle (see Chapter 16). You can"
"start a new position by placing the first trade for one-quarter or one-third the"

"Applying stops to adjusted positions"
"If you’re using an indicator stop and it signals that the price rise is over,"
"doesn’t that mean you want to exit all positions at the same level as soon as"
"possible? The answer from statisticians is “maybe.” It depends on whether"

"demand,” as in an auction. Such buyers may be insiders or option trad-"
"ers trying to trigger a specific price level."
"✓ A trader may be trying to test a support or a resistance line (which I"

"the probability of picking the right direction (up or down) is very low. You’d"
"just be guessing. And although you have to accept imperfection and a cer-"

"Trading range"
"In every instance of special bars in this chapter, the size of the daily high-low"
"range is a key factor. The daily trading range is the difference between the"
"high and the low of the day. You can also say that the range defines the emo-"
"tional extremes of the day:"

"is indecisive. Indecisiveness isn’t the same thing as indifference."
"Indecisiveness can be dangerous — nobody wanted to buy at a higher"
"high, so perhaps buyers are getting tired of that security at current"
"prices. A change in sentiment may be brewing, such as deceleration in a"

"Gaps are usually triggered by news, like earnings or some other event,"
"whether true or invented (rumors). Events are the source of most key price"
"moves, especially gaps. Prices don’t, on the whole, move randomly — traders"
"have reasons, right or wrong, to buy and sell. Even the strongest trend can be"
"broken by a piece of fresh news contrary to the trend direction. Authentically"
"big news trumps the chart (nearly) every time."
""
"That’s why gaps are such a valuable pattern — you know instantly how the"
"market is interpreting the news. The reason to read bars is to get an accurate"
"assessment of whether news is big or merely ordinary. Some news is easy"
"to interpret. News will start a new uptrend if it’s wildly favorable or halt an"
"uptrend dead in its tracks if it’s wildly unfavorable. But much of the time, you"
"don’t know how to interpret news — and there is so much news! — until you"
"see how the market treats it in the form of the bar on the chart. Traders often"
"get the bit between their teeth on news and this is especially clear with gaps."
""
"Consider how a gap develops. Say that Blue Widget stock closes on Monday"
"at $15 per share. After the closing bell, it announces bad news — the book-"
"keeper embezzled several million dollars and ran off to Rio. (You’ve probably"
"noticed how companies always wait, if they can, until after the market closes to"
"deliver bad news. Presumably they hope that what looks just awful at 5 p.m."
"won’t look so bad the next morning.) However, in this case, the market is"
"unforgiving and the next day, Blue Widget opens gap down at $10. Most"
"people deduce that the opening gap down implies further price drops, and"
"they proceed to sell — in droves."
""
"The total gap for the day may not be $5, though. During the course of the"
"day, Blue Widget may trade as high as $12, making the net gap a $3 gap. If the"
"price of Blue Widget normally trades in a $2 high-low range, $3 is still a sig-"
"nificant number — 50 percent higher than normal. Gaps are significant when"
"they’re proportionally large compared to the trading range (see the “Kicking"
"things off: Breakaway gaps” section in this chapter)."
""
"Gaps occur with good news, too. If Blue Widget announces a fabulous new"
"discovery, the opening price on the following day may be a gap up, like the"
"one in Figure 7-3. You may deduce from this gap that some traders (including"
"well-paid professional analysts) had a whole night to evaluate the news, and"
"they bought the stock at the open, so you should buy it, too. The gap implies"
"buyers anticipate the stock rising throughout the day from the opening price,"
"and you want to jump (if not leap) on this bandwagon."

"it would take more than one gap to deliver this outcome. Gaps almost never"

"In regular bar work, say that you are merrily averaging your daily high-low"
"ranges and suddenly you have a gap. You need to account for that gap or you"
"will be literally missing something. Figure 7-8 displays the problem. On Day 1,"
"the high-low range is $2. The next day, the price opens gap up, but the daily"
"range is the same $2. Therefore, the average range for the two days is also $2."
"Looking at the average range alone, without inspecting every bar and every"
"space on the chart, you wouldn’t know that the gap occurred. Well, so what?"
"Maybe the gap is just a common old gap that doesn’t mean anything (see the"
"“Lacking opportunity: Common gaps” section in this chapter). If it were an"
"important gap, like a breakaway gap (see the “Kicking things off: Breakaway"
"gaps” section in this chapter), you’d see the range expanding (plus a rise in"
"volume), and the whole issue would be moot, right?"

"The reason you need to account for the gap is that it often precedes a longer-"
"term change in the range, which is what you’re looking for. If you measure"
"each day separately and average those numbers, the range looks the same"
"from day to day. For the first two days in Figure 7-8, though, the range is actu-"
"ally from the low on Day 1 at $1 to the high on Day 2 at $7 — or a $6 range."
"In short, the range doubled but the averaging process doesn’t capture this"
"change. In fact, if the range on Day 2 had been smaller, say $1.50, the average"
"would be less than $2. Just looking at the average range on a numerical basis,"

"Appreciating the Candlestick Advantage"
"Candlesticks are visually compelling. You can quickly and easily figure out"
"how to identify a handful of the top candlestick patterns. Here are some of"
"the advantages you can expect:"
""
"✓ Many candlesticks are simple to use and interpret, making it a splendid"
"place for a beginner to start figuring out bar analysis — as well as for old"
"hands to achieve new insights. Your eye adapts almost immediately to"
"the information in the bar notation."
"✓ Candlesticks and candlestick patterns have delightfully descriptive and"
"memorable names — charming and sometimes alarming — that contain"
"the seeds of interpretation. The names help you remember what the"
"pattern means. Among the colorful names are “abandoned baby,” “dark"
"cloud cover,” and “spinning top.”"
"✓ Candlestick bar patterns and their interpretation are widely known, so"
"you can expect other participants in the market to respond in a specific"
"way to specific patterns."
"✓ You can use candlesticks on any chart, with any other indicators, just"
"like standard bars."
"✓ Candlestick shapes can be dramatic, so they can often bring your atten-"
"tion to a trend change earlier than standard bars do. As I describe in"
"Chapter 7, some exceptional bar patterns embody a forecast that’s"
"usually correct, such as the breakaway gap and the island reversal."
"Standard bar analysis offers very few such patterns, but candlestick"
"analysis offers dozens."
"✓ Candlestick patterns excel in identifying strategic market turning points —"
"reversals from an uptrend to a downtrend or a downtrend to an uptrend."

"Dissecting the Anatomy of a Candlestick"
"Ready to dive into the components of the candlestick? The first thing you"

"Figure 8-1, the open and the close mark at the top and bottom of the box,"
"named the real body. A thin vertical line at the top and bottom of the real"

"Shadows in the doji bar"
"In many instances, the doji is just a plain one with ordinary, same-size shad-"
"ows, as shown in Figure 8-2. However, the two most useful types of doji bars,"
"also shown in Figure 8-2, are the following:"
""
"✓ Dragonfly doji: Look for the long, lower shadow that means the open,"
"high, and close were the same or nearly the same. Sellers were trying to"
"push the price down and succeeded in making a low — but they didn’t"
"succeed in getting it to close there. Because the close was back up at or"
"near the open, buyers must have emerged before the end of trading and"
"bought enough to move the close to the high or nearly to the high."
"How you interpret the dragonfly depends on what bar patterns precede"
"it. Your options include the following:"
"• If the price move is a downtrend, the dragonfly may mean that"
"buyers are emerging and the downtrend may be ending."
"• If the dragonfly appears after a series of uptrending bars, buyers"
"failed to push the price over the open to a new high while sellers"
"succeeded in getting a low, so the uptrend may be in trouble."
"✓ Gravestone doji: Take a look at that long upper shadow in Figure 8-2."
"This bar, the exact opposite of the dragonfly, is formed when the open,"
"low, and close are the same or nearly the same, but a high creates a long"
"upper shadow. Although buyers succeeded in pushing the price to a"
"high over the open, by the end of the day the bears were fighting back"
"and pushed the price back to close near the open and the low. This push"
"is a failed effort at a rally, but you can interpret the bar best in the con-"
"text of the other bars that precede it:"
"• If the gravestone bar appears after a series of uptrending bars,"
"buyers failed to get the close at the high. Sellers dominated and"
"the uptrend is at risk of ending."

"and the close, whether the real body is black or white. Here’s how you"
"can interpret a really long upper shadow:"
"• If the price series is in an uptrend, the long upper shadow is a"

"upper shadow may signal a weakening of the uptrend. If a long"
"upper shadow follows a doji bar indicating indecisiveness, you"
"should worry that the uptrend may be over."
"• If the price series is on a downtrend, the long upper shadow sug-"
"gests that some market participants are buying at higher levels."
"Especially if a long upper shadow follows a doji bar, you should"
"wonder if the downtrend might be ending."
"✓ Long lower shadow: A long lower shadow means that the low of the day"
"came well under both the open and the close, whether the real body is"
"black or white. Here’s what that means in the technical analysis world:"
"• If the price series is trending down, the long lower shadow is a"
"failure to close near the low. If the downtrend is nearing a support"
"level (see Chapter 10), the long lower shadow may signal a weaken-"
"ing or an end of the downtrend."
"• If the price series is trending up, the long lower shadow suggests"
"that traders were not willing to keep buying at the high levels right"
"up to the close. They were exiting under the high, and therefore"
"think that new highs are not warranted. This signal can be a warn-"
"ing sign of the trend decelerating or ending."

"bounce occurs only in down moves and no equivalent named pattern exists"

"The dead-cat pattern starts off with a negative fundamental event that triggers"

"even partly, the preceding move has ended. The dead-cat bounce is one of"
"the patterns that disproves that idea — by the end of six months after the"
"gap, only 54 percent of price moves had fully closed the gap in the Bulkowski"
"study, which found 244 versions of the dead-cat bounce pattern in 500 stocks"

"familiar with initiating a short position, or selling a security first and"
"buying it back later after its price has fallen. Commodity traders, on the"
"other hand, are familiar with the practice. After all, we’re striving to be"
"emotionally neutral about whether prices are rising or falling. Why not"
"profit symmetrically? To make a profit only when a price is rising is to"
"lose 50 percent of the opportunity presented by trend-following."

"the line. The price falls off the cliff. But the price never returns to this first"
"resistance line. Instead you get the opportunity to draw a new resistance line"
"a few months later."

"An experienced trader would probably see the new line as an opportunity to"
"increase his short position. A long-only trader would be watching this second"

"that lasts only until the price nears the topmost resistance line, where it will"
"face (you guessed it) resistance. Note that selling this security on the third"
"touch of resistance and covering the short position when the price breaks the"

"day touches the resistance line and doesn’t cross it, the more confidence"
"you have that it is a valid description of the trend. This is called a test of"

"Combining Point-and-Figure Techniques"
"with Other Indicators"
"The innate simplicity of point-and-figure charting is appealing, but you can"
"add value to decision making by speeding up the buy/sell signal or seeking"
"confirmation or lack of confirmation from other indicators. Because other"
"indicators are time based, how can this merger be done?"
""
"Here’s how you can use point-and-figure charting along with other indicators"
"I mention in this book:"
""
"✓ Moving averages: You use the price at the center of each column in"
"calculating a moving average in P&F charts, instead of the usual method"
"of averaging prices over a fixed number of periods. Thus you are using"
"the average price per reversal. If the moving average shows that you had"
"a downtrend and now you get a new column of Xs that rises over the"
"moving average, you have more confidence that the Xs really do imply a"
"rising trend and thus a safer buy signal."
"✓ Parabolic stop-and-reverse indicator: The parabolic stop-and-reverse"
"(SAR) indicator delivers a speedier reversal than waiting for a new column"
"of Xs or Os. (See Chapter 5.) The parabolic SAR has the advantage of tight-"
"ening your stop as the momentum of a price move decelerates."
"✓ Bollinger bands: Data displayed in the P&F format can’t display momen-"
"tum and thus overbought or oversold, a shortcoming that can be"
"partly addressed by applying Bollinger bands (see Chapter 14). If your"
"columns of Xs persist in pressing against the top of the band and some-"
"times breaking it, you have confirmation of the uptrend. When the next"
"column of Os crosses the centerline (a simple moving average) to the"
"downside, you expect a swing all the way to the bottom band."
"Finally, Bollinger bands are wide apart when volatility is high, and they"
"“squeeze” narrower as volatility dissipates and prices become con-"
"gested. In a congestion, P&F prices are in a series of short columns that"
"you can’t trust to deliver a reliable buy-or-sell signal. When you see the"
"short columns together with the narrow Bollinger band, you can guess"
"that the market is fickle — it’s not trending, and you should go find"
"something else to trade."

"Expecting a Positive Result"
"The main reason to add bothersome complexity is to improve gains or"
"reduce losses, or both. But you need to have some idea that the overall con-"
"ditions are right to make any trade in the first place. This section can help"
"you do just that."
""
""
""
"Calculating positive expectancy"
"technically"
"The first question to ask yourself is whether the security in front of you right"
"now offers an opportunity to make a profit. As statisticians say, you want to have"
"a positive expectancy that a gain is possible. Not every security offers a profit"
"potential. If it is range-trading sideways with low volatility (see Chapter 14),"
"profit potential is low unless you know how to trade options."
""
"In general terms, a positive-expectancy trade is one that"
""
"✓ Displays a bar configuration or pattern that generates profits a high"
"percentage of the time"
"✓ Has multiple confirming indicators, as discussed in the “Adding a New"
"Indicator: Introducing Complexity” section earlier in the chapter"
"✓ Offers an obvious exit, like a spike high or the downside break of a"
"support line that occurs before your stop-loss kicks in"
""
"Think of the trade as a process in which the evidence mounts that the indicators"
"are correct. Don’t neglect the configuration of the price bars themselves and"
"obvious patterns. See Figure 16-5 and take a look at the following numbered list"
"that corresponds to the numbers on the chart:"
""
"1. The price puts in three days of higher highs and higher lows, and then"
"rises above a resistance line (see Chapter 10)."
"2. The price gaps to the upside (see Chapter 7)."
"3. At the same time, the price crosses above the 20-day simple moving"
"average inside the Bollinger band (Chapter 14)."
"4. A few days later, the relative strength indicator in the top window"
"crosses the buy/sell line to the upside."
"5. A few days later, the MACD in the bottom window crosses its buy/sell"
"line to the upside, confirming RSI."
"6. Finally, the price breaks out above the Bollinger band top, a continua-"
"tion signal that suggests the trend will keep going up."

"Evaluating Efficient Entries"
"and Ruthless Exits: Setups"
"Setup trading is a form of swing trading that’s very popular today. A setup is"
"a particular configuration of bars, usually with one or two other confirming"
"conditions like a pattern or an indicator, that delivers an expected outcome"
"in a high proportion of trades. The opening range breakout I describe in the"
"“Standing the Test of Time: Simple Ideas” section earlier in the chapter is an"
"excellent example of a setup. Candlestick trading can be considered setup"
"trading, too (see Chapter 8)."
""
"Setups usually have catchy names (like pinball and coiled spring). Do these"
"setups work? If you identify the setup correctly, yes, the price does often"
"behave in the predicted manner. Unfortunately, statistics on exactly what"
"percentage of the time they do work don’t exist, but experienced setup trad-"
"ers say that setups work often enough that early entry gives you an edge."
""
"Each setup identifies a specific market condition that can be explained in"
"terms of market psychology. Setup analysis is promiscuous, borrowing from"
"bar reading, pattern identification, and indicators. Setups are effective tools"
"when you can read the supply and demand dynamics on the chart — you"
"can imagine what traders must be thinking, such as the predictable burst of"
"buying after a test of support. In general, you’re counting on the normal swing"
"of Newtonian action-reaction and the principles of support and resistance."
""
"One benefit of setup trading is that you can be out of the market until you"
"spot a setup situation. You take no risk when you’re out of the market. Some"
"setup trades are intraday, where you enter and exit the trade on the same"
"day. Other setup trades are more long lasting because they lead to authentic"
"trends that you stick to until your exit rules or stop is hit. In the next section,"
"I describe some aspects of trading setups."
""
""
""
"Starting off early"
"A setup identifies the conditions that precede and accompany a price move,"
"giving you a head start in entering a trade. When you correctly identify the"
"setup, the price goes in your direction immediately. And when a strong move"
"begins, the first few days can account for 25 percent or more of the total"
"move. That’s the thrust or impulse aspect of new moves."

"Having just poured cold water on the idea of building a system, why include"
"this chapter at all? Two reasons. First, building a system forces you to exam-"
"ine indicator effectiveness and reliability in a strict and fact-based way. It"
"also opens the door to refining your money-management rules, which often"
"yields as much or more profit than replacing indicators or adjusting indicator"
"parameters. Second, the process is a scientific one. You create a hypothesis,"
"you test it, and you get results that can be evaluated to refine the hypothesis"
"for another round of tests. The scientific process is disciplined. If you aren’t"
"scientifically trained or oriented, having a system is invaluable to help you"
"discard sloppy thinking, unwarranted assumptions, and general bias."

"Defining a Trading System"
"The term trading system has different meanings to different people. Systematic"
"trading can be as simple as a single indicator and a stop-loss rule (for more"
"on these topics see Chapters 4 and 16). In fact, most folks in the technical"
"analysis field now refer to any trading regime as a system, even when it"
"doesn’t meet the strict requirement of full automation. In this chapter, I"
"speak of a trading system in the strictest sense — every decision is dictated in"
"advance by the indicators and trading rules that you set down."
""
"A trading system is built, block by block, by accumulating trading rules to"
"convert indicators or other data inputs into buy/sell signals. A trading system"
"becomes a robot when it executes the trades as well as determines them."
"These decisions include position size and other aspects of the trading plan."
"Instead of laboriously figuring out how many shares of Blue Widget to buy or"
"sell depending on your changing risk preference and market volatility (see"
"Chapter 16), the machine does it for you. Instead of selecting from among a"
"menu of indicators and trading rules to reenter after a stop or target is hit,"
"the machine does it for you."

"A trading system is a mechanical trading system when it dictates every single"

"Definitions for a mechanical trading system vary, but most systems designers"
"would agree on the bare minimum:"
""
"✓ You backtested every indicator and combination of indicators over a"
"large set of historical data and have determined that the indicator set"
"generates a favorable gain-loss ratio."
"✓ The system contains enough trading rules so that whatever the con-"
"tingency, you never need to make a judgment call. You have already"
"provided directions ahead of time. As noted in a previous section, this"
"really cannot be done in full. Why? Because of what Nassim Nicholas"
"Taleb named black swans — highly improbable events. Do traders ever"
"get a new black swan? In other words, an event shock of a type never"
"seen before? Maybe not. Human history is a long affair and perhaps"
"nothing is ever really new. But programming every contingency into"
"trading rules is a vast and probably impossible task."
"✓ You follow the system without fail and without overriding the signals"
"by using judgment. You take every trade that the system gives you, if"
"only because you never know which signal is the one that’ll generate the"
"juicy profit. And in most systems, the successful backtest track record"
"depends on those big profits to offset many small losses."

"Backtest Your Indicators Properly"
"You’re free to use the standard indicator parameters in software packages"
"and on Web sites. Experience shows that the standard parameters are useful"
"over large amounts of data and large numbers of securities — that’s why"
"their inventors chose them. For this reason, some traders never feel the need"
"to perform their own backtests. They accept the standard parameters and"
"put their effort into something else, like bar or pattern reading."
""
"But if you are going to backtest indicators to refine the parameters, do it"
"right. Use a large amount of price history when testing an indicator — and"
"don’t make the indicator fit history so perfectly that the minute you add"
"fresh data, the indicator becomes worthless (a waste of time called curve-"
"fitting). Observing price behavior and estimating the range of sensible and"
"reasonable parameters is better than finding the perfect number. The perfect"

"Hard assets include precious metals such as gold and industrial metals such"

"Leverage Is Dangerous"
"When your indicators fall in line one by one to increase your confidence"
"in your trade, you may be tempted to increase your position by borrow-"
"ing money to supplement your starting capital. Leverage is the use of debt"
"issued by brokers to traders. In the U.S. equity markets, the most a trader"
"can borrow from the broker is 50 percent of the face amount of the trade,"
"with each broker applying its own standards so that the amount of leverage"
"extended to the trader is often a great deal less. In commodity trading and in"
"some foreign markets, the allowable leverage is a lot higher."
""
"In foreign exchange, for example, leverage of 100 to 300 times used to be"
"commonplace but was reduced in 2010 to 50 times. Even this reduction in"
"leverage means that the trader with a capital stake deposited at the broker"
"of $10,000 can trade contracts collectively worth $500,000. It should go"
"without saying that trading with such high leverage is seldom a good idea, if"

"Internationalization raises market participation and thus liquidity, but also"
"introduces new uncertainties to your comfort level in your technical analysis."

"Hedge Funds and Sovereign Wealth"
"Funds Are the New Big Dogs"
"Hedge funds were invented in the late 1940s and sovereign wealth funds in"
"1953 (Kuwait) but accelerated as a trend around 2000. Both types of funds"
"embrace trading strategies that travel far beyond the buy-and-hold idea,"
"including sophisticated technical analysis applications as well as the following:"
""
"✓ Taking short positions to benefit from down markets"
"✓ Diversifying holdings into asset classes previously dominated by a small"
"group of specialists (such as oil, metals, and agricultural commodities)"
"✓ Getting into emerging markets"
""
"Hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds are run by well-educated, advanced-"
"math managers who question conventional ways of thinking about markets,"
"and in many cases engage in algorithmic trading, including high-frequency"
"trading. They are the big new players or “agents” in many markets. As techni-"
"cal analysis-oriented players with deep pockets, they are market leaders and"

"ally with security, storage, and analytical options built in. Some platforms,"
"such as Metatrader, allow open-source contributions from users that are"
"then available to everyone."
""
"Among the first major trading platforms was TradeStation, which started as"
"a technical analysis software company and transformed itself into a broker"
"that offers live, online technical analysis woven into the order-entry pro-"
"cess. Interactive Data is another broker that joined with data and technical"
"analysis vendor eSignal. Instead of doing your chart work on one PC and then"
"switching to the broker’s electronic order-entry Website, you perform all the"
"functions in one space — and with the platform offering you ideas, analysis,"
"and real-time alerts. Anyone can build an automated trading system using an"
"advanced platform — this is, of course, both a curse and an opportunity."

"Exchange-Traded Funds"
"Have Made Their Mark"
"Exchange-traded funds (ETF) is a class of investment fund that bundles"
"together related securities and trades like an individual stock on an"
"exchange. An ETF consists of a basket of securities that trades in its own"
"right as a proxy for the collection. For example, the SPDR (“Spider”)"
"exchange-traded fund serves as a proxy for the S&P 500 index."
""
"From a single ETF in 1993, the range of ETFs expanded to nearly a thousand"
"ETFs in the U.S. alone, with more being created by the month. Most ETFs rep-"
"licate the performance of a stock, bond, or commodity market — or take a"
"position that effectively shorts that market. ETFs are an alternative to mutual"
"funds, which create a pool of generally unrelated securities and almost never"
"outperform the market indices. ETFs, while designed to trade at about the"
"same price as the net asset value of its components, are subject to supply and"
"demand of their own, and prices can vary widely from the collective prices of"
"the underlying securities. ETFs sometimes offer double or triple leverage and"
"can trade erratically, which reduces confidence in your technical analysis."
