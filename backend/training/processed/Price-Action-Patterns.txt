A List Of The Most
Important Price 
Action Patterns 

To be a price action trader means having a deep understanding of the various 
different price action patterns that form in the market. The problem with these 
pattern, is that because there are so many of them that form in the market, 
knowing which ones you should take the time out to learn and which you should 
leave can be quite challenging. To solve this problem, I thought that today I 
would give you a list of what I believe to be the most important price action 
patterns you need to learn as a forex trader.
As some of you reading this will probably already know, there are three basic 
types of pattern that can form in the market:
• Price Action Reversal Patterns
• Price Action Continuation Patterns
• Price Action Candlestick Pattern
I'll begin today's article by first showing you what the most important price action 
reversal patterns are, followed by which continuation patterns you need to have 
knowledge on, and finally I'll show you the two most important price action 
candlestick patterns you need to watch out for in the market.
Price Action Reversal Patterns
Reversal patterns are probably the most important set of price action patterns 
you need to really have a deep understanding of, as they can give you early 
clues about if a movement in the market is coming to an end. The six patterns 
I'm going to be showing you in this section are all multi-swing shape patterns, 
which means that each one of the patterns forms from more than one upswing 
and downswing taking place in the market, and they all look similar to common 
shapes upon their completion.
The Head And Shoulders Pattern
The first price action reversal pattern we're going to look at is the head and 
shoulders pattern. Without doubt one of the most popular and well known price 
action patterns in the market, the head and shoulders formation is one which all 
price action traders need to memorize and understand if they want to become 
good at spotting reversals using price action. As you've probably already 
guessed, the head and shoulders pattern is a reversal pattern which has a swing
structure very similar to that of person's head and shoulders.
