      "text": "History of candlesticks Candlesticks have been around a lot longer than anything similar in the Western world. The Japanese were looking at charts as far back as the 17th century, whereas the earliest known charts in the US appeared in the late 19th century. Rice trading had been established in Japan in 1654, with gold, silver and rape seed oil following soon after. Rice markets dominated Japan at this time and the commodity became, it seems, more important than hard currency. Munehisa Homma (aka Sokyu Honma), a Japanese rice trader born in the early 1700s, is widely credited as being one of the early exponents of tracking price action. He understood basic supply and demand dynamics, but also identified the fact that emotion played a part in the setting of price. He wanted to track the emotion of the market players, and this work became the basis of candlestick analysis. He was extremely well respected, to the point of being promoted to Samurai status. The Japanese did an extremely good job of keeping candlesticks quiet from the Western world, right up until the 1980s, when suddenly there was a large cross-pollination of banks and financial institutions around the world. This is when Westerners suddenly got wind of these mystical charts. Obviously, this was also about the time that charting in general suddenly became a lot easier, due to the widespread use of the PC. In the late 1980s several Western analysts became interested in candlesticks. In the UK Michael Feeny, who was then head of TA in"

In the December 1989 edition of Futures magazine Steve Nison, who was a technical analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, produced a paper that showed a series of candlestick reversal patterns and explained their predictive powers. He went on to write a book on the subject, and a fine book it is too. Thank you Messrs Feeny and Nison. Since then candlesticks have gained in popularity by the year, and these days they seem to be the standard template that most analysts work from. Why candlesticks are important to your trading analysis? -Candlesticks are important to you trading analysis because, it is considered as a visual representation of what is going on in the market. By looking at a candlestick, we can get valuable information about the open, high, low and the close of price, which will give us an idea about the price movement. -Candlesticks are flexible, they can be used alone or in combination with technical analysis tools such as the moving averages, and momentum oscillators, they can be used also with methods such the Dow Theory or the Eliot wave theory. I personally use candlesticks with support and resistance, trend lines, and other technical tools that you will discover in the next chapters. -The human behavior in relation to money is always dominated by fear; greed, and hope, candlestick analysis will help us understand these changing psychological factors by showing us how buyers and sellers interact with each other’s. -Candlesticks provide more valuable information than bar charts, using them is a win-win situation, because you can get all the trading signals 9 THE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE"

What you have to remember is that a ranging market moves horizontally between the support and the resistance level. These are the key levels that you have to focus on.

These three aspects which are the trend, the level, and the signal are what we will use in our trading approach to make money trading any financial market. I mean that when you open a chart, you will try to answer three important questions: 1-What the market is doing? Is it trending, consolidating, or is it a choppy market? If it is trending, you know how to identify if it is an uptrend or a downtrend. If it is a ranging market, you will see that it is trading horizontally between two boundaries. And if it is a choppy market, you close your chart and you stay away. 2-What are the most powerful levels in this market?

In this section, you will learn in detail how to identify potential pin bar signals, and the conditions needed for high probability setups. A pin bar is a chart candlestick, it is characterized by a very long tail that shows rejection and indicates that the market will move in the opposite direction. The area between the open and close is called the real body, typically all pin bars have a very small real body and a long shadow. A Bullish pin bar is known for its lower wicks, and the bearish one is characterized by long upper wicks, the color of the candlestick is not quite important, however, bullish candles with white real body are more powerful than candles with a real black body. On the other hand, a bearish pin bars with black real bodies are more important than the ones with white real bodies. See how pin bars look like below:\n\n81 THE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE"

That happens a couple of times, because the market doesn’t move due to pin bar formations, what moves the market is the law of supply and demand. Let me give you an example, if you identify a quality pin bar candle near a support key level in an uptrend market, this is a powerful buying signal to take, you shouldn’t ignore it, but if the amount of money that buyers put in this trade is less than the amount of money that sellers\n\n82 THE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE"

You May ask yourself, why should we look for quality pin bar setups if the market doesn’t respect them??? As you know, trading is a game of probabilities, there is no certainty, this is why you should evaluate your pin bar setups from multiple angles, and the fact that you are looking for quality setups means that you are trying to put the probabilities of success in your favor which is the right mindset of successful traders. To determine whether or not a pin bar is worth trading, this price action signal should respect the following criteria: -The pin bar formed in bigger time frames such as the 4 hour or daily time frame should be taken into consideration, because if you look at smaller time frames, you can easily spot lot of pin bar signals, these setups should be ignored, because smaller time frames generate lot of false signals.

Pin bars with longer tails are more powerful. The Psychology behind the pin bar candle formation: Pin bars are formed when prices are rejected, this rejection doesn’t indicate a reversal signal, because this price action setup can form everywhere in your chart. The most important areas to watch when trading pin bars are major key levels such as: support and resistance, supply and demand zones, and moving averages. The formation of this candlestick chart pattern in these levels give a clear idea about what happens in the market.

If prices test a support level and stop, this is an indication that buyers are there, this area is watched by all participants in the market, because it represents a great buying opportunity. Conversely, if prices test a resistance level and stop in an uptrend, this is a clear signal that selling strength is in the market.

And they sell the market when it is below the 200 simple moving average -To determine whether the market is overbought or oversold we just watch how prices interact with the moving averages, for example, in an uptrend, if prices move far from the moving averages, this is an indication that the market is overbought. -To predict the trend, change by using the crossover strategy, if the moving average crosses over another, it is a signal of a trend reversal. As any trading system, the moving averages have disadvantages; this is why you have to know how to use it successfully under the right market conditions. This trading technical tool doesn’t apply to all markets, don’t never try to use it in range bound or untradeable markets.

This trade has 3:1 risk to reward which increases your chances to be winner in the long term, because if you risk 200 dollars in this trade, you are likely to win 600 dollars. It is very important to calculate your risk to reward ratio before taking any single trade. Case study Imagine you take 10 trades with 3:1 risk /reward on each single trade, I mean when you win you get 600 dollars, and when the market goes against you, you lose 200 dollars. Let’s suppose you lost 7 trades and you won just 3 trades. Let’s do the math to know if you are winner or loser. Seven losing trades will cost you 1400 dollars, and 3 wining trades will make you 1800 dollars. As you see you lost seven trades, but you are still making money.

Banks and financial institutions know how we trade the market, they know how we think, and where we put our stop losses and profit targets, this is the reason why they could easily take money from us. One of the most famous strategies that big players use to take money from novice traders is called stop loss hunting strategy. This strategy consists of driving prices to a certain level where there are massive stop loss orders, and the purpose is to create liquidity, because without liquidity, the market will not move. Once stop losses are hunt, the market goes strongly in the predicted direction.

The first reason is the trend, it is obviously down, the second reason is the key Fibonacci ratios that represent a resistance level, and the third one is the inside bar false breakout. One signal is not quite enough to make a good trading decision, you have to look for multiple triggers that support your analysis, this way, you will put the odds of success in your favor.

The formation of the inside bar false breakout in this area indicates that the pullback has finished and another strong move will take place. Understanding the market structure is very important to know how to use this strategy in your advantage, if the market is trending, you can trade the inside bar false breakout as we discussed before. But if the market is ranging, you have to change your tactic.

The false breakout has formed because amateurs tried to predict the breakout of the inside bar and the horizontal level early to pick the top, but the market fake them out and formed a bull trap. If you find this pattern in your chart, and you understand that buyers were trapped by sellers, take this trade without hesitation, because it is very profitable and it has a good risk/reward. You place a selling order after the close of the break bar, and you set your stop loss above it, your profit target is the next support level. This strategy is not complicated, but it requires time and practice to master it, bear in mind that a false breakout doesn’t happen every time, and not all false breakouts are worth trading. The benefits of trading the false breakout of the inside bar candlestick pattern: If you master trading this pattern, this will allow to stay away from trapped traders and enter the market when novice traders have to get out with a loss. This strategy is not a holy grail, you have to be prepared to accept some losing trades, but what is interesting about it, is that the risk reward of this signal has a great potential, because when big participants surprises amateurs and take their money, the market moves very strongly, and if you can analyze correctly what happened, you will enter in the right time and make big profits. Imagine risking say 50 points for 400 points profits. Using this price action strategy will help you predict proper turning points in the market in advance and understand how banks and financial institutions trade the market."

See the first example below:\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, the market is trending down, so as a price action trader, i will try to follow the trend and look for powerful signals at the most powerful key levels. The first signal we got is a pin bar that was rejected from a support level that becomes resistance. The second factor that support our decision to sell the market is the rejection of the pin from the 50% Fibonacci retracement.\n\n158 THE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE"

The second signal was an engulfing bar candlestick pattern, as you can see in the chart, this candlestick pattern was formed at a resistance level in line with the direction of the market. This is how you can trade trending markets using our price action signals. It’s simple just identify the trend, and the key levels, it can be a support or resistance level, a 21 moving averages, or 50% and 61% Fibonacci retracement. Wait for a pin bar, an engulfing bar, an inside bar, or an inside bar false breakout to form near these levels in line with the direction of the market, and then execute your trade.

In ranging markets, we trade from the boundaries, i mean from support and resistance levels, don’t never try to trade inside the range. In the chart above, we had two powerful signals, the first signal was a pin bar that was strongly rejected from the resistance level, and the second signal was an inside bar formed near the support level. See another chart below:\n\n160 THE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, there are three powerful pin bar signals.

This is important for you as a trader to know, but you are still missing the key to the castle. The money management plan. The most important thing that traders don’t talk about is the money management. This is what makes a difference between successful traders and losers. If you trade without a money management plan, you are just wasting your time and money. Because nothing is going to work for you, even if you have the most powerful trading system in the world. Most traders focus on how to enter the market, they spend months and years looking for the right system. i don’t want you to think like them, you should think differently if you want to become a successful trader. Money management: Position sizing One of the most important component of money management is position sizing, what i mean by position sizing is the number of lots you are risking per trade. All forex brokers now offer mini lots as the default position size. The smallest value for a mini lot is approximately 1$. There are forex brokers that offer 10 cents for a mini lot which represent an opportunity for traders who don’t have bigger accounts, they can begin with 250$, and they still have chance to grow it. When it comes to position sizing, you should think in terms of dollars instead of pips. Let’s say you are trading 3 mini lots of CAD/USA, this means you bought or sold 30.000 worth of us dollars."

Let’s break it down, 1standard lot is worth about 10$ per pip. And 1mini lot is worth about 1$ per pip, and 1 micro lot is equal to 10 cents. If you open a mini trading account, you should think in term of the dollars risked instead of pips. Let’s say you put 50 pips stop loss and 100 pips as a profit target. This means that if the market hits your stop loss you will lose 50 pips which is 50$, and if the market hit the profit target, you will win 100$. The size of your position depends on whether you have a standard or a mini account, and how many lots you are trading. This information is important to you because this will help you know how much money you risk on each trade. The risk to reward ratio The risk to reward ratio concept is what will make you a winner in the long run. Before you enter any trade, you have to know how much money you will win if the market goes in your favor, and how much money you will lose if the market goes against you. Don’t never enter a trade in which the profit is less than the amount of money you risked. If you will risk 100$ for example, your profit target should be at least 200$, this is a risk to reward ratio of 1:2. Let’s suppose that you took 10 trades with 1:2 risks to reward ratio. In every trade you risk 100$. You won 5trades, and you lost 5 trades. So you will lose 500$.but you will win 1000$.so the benefits is 500$. This is the power of the risk to reward ratio, you shouldn’t think that you have to win all your trades to become a successful trader. If you"

      "text": "The importance of a Stop loss All good methodologies use stops. A protective stop loss is an order to exit a long or short position when prices move against you to specified price. The stop loss insures against a usually large loss and has to be used in one way or another. An initial stop loss can be placed with your order on the trading platform; the trade will be closed, automatically when if the stop loss is hit. This type of stop loss will allow you to execute your trade and go spend time with your family or friends, this will help you to trade out of your emotion, because you know how much money you will lose if the market didn’t go in your direction. Lot of traders use mental stops, when they enter a trade, they don’t place a stop loss, because they think that the broker will hit their stop loss which is not true. The reason behind using mental stop is the human psychology, humans hate to lose money. And if you don’t accept losing money as a part of the game, you will never make money in the market. Don’t never think of using mental stops, because you can’t control the market, you can’t be sure that the market will do this or that. Before you enter a trade, calculate how much you may win, and how much you may lose. Place your stop loss order. And your profit target. And forget about your trade. Don’t ever risk money that you can’t afford to lose I got lot of questions from traders asking me about how much money they need to start trading. First of all, you have to take trading as a business. You can make money in this business and you can lose it as well. 165 THE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE"

Because you will be controlled by your emotion, and this will affect your trading decisions. You will not be able to follow your trading strategy, and you will certainly fail.
