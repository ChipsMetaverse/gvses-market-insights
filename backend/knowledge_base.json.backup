The levels \nmust be clear, don’t try to force a trend line. \nDon’t use smaller time frame to draw trend lines, use always the 4H \nand the daily time frames to find obvious trend lines. \nWe will try to focus right now on how to draw them in a trending \nmarkets, our purpose is to identify the beginning of impulsive moves \nin a trending market. \n In the next chapter, i will explain you in detail how to trade trend lines \nin combination with our price action trading setups. \n See an example of how to draw trend lines in a downtrend market. \n \n \nAs you can see the market respects the trend line, and when price \napproach it, the market reverse and continue in the same direction.",

And \nthis is the quickest way to blow up your trading account. \nIf you focus just on bigger time frames, this will allow you to set and \nforget your trade instead of being emotionally controlled by the \nmarket. \n2- Trade the dominant trend  \nYou should start trading inside bars in line with the direction of the \nmarket, especially in a strong bullish or bearish trend, but don’t never \ntry to trade it against the trend if you are a newbie. \nWhen you feel like you master trading this pattern with the trend, you \ncan move to trade range bound markets, and counter trends. \n3- Trade only from key levels  \nRemember that not all inside bars are worth your hard-earned money; \nthere are specific locations where this setup works great, so make sure \nthat your signal is located in a key level in the market. \n4- Find different factors of confluence  \nTrading with confluence means combining different signals to make \nthe best trading decision.",

I have been a victim of stop \nhunting, and i was very disappointed, but that happens several times \nin the market. \nBanks and financial institutions know how we trade the market, they \nknow how we think, and where we put our stop losses and profit \ntargets, this is the reason why they could easily take money from us. \nOne of the most famous strategies that big players use to take money \nfrom novice traders is called stop loss hunting strategy. \nThis strategy consists of driving prices to a certain level where there \nare massive stop loss orders, and the purpose is to create liquidity, \nbecause without liquidity, the market will not move.  \nOnce stop losses are hunt, the market goes strongly in the predicted \ndirection. \nThe interaction between big participants and novice traders create \nrepetitive patterns in the market, one of the most important \ncandlestick pattern that illustrates how big financial institutions \nmanipulate the market is the inside bar false breakout pattern. \nYour understanding of this repetitive setup and your ability to detect \nit on your charts will help you better exploit it to make money instead \nof being a victim of market makers and banks manipulations. \nThis price action signal is formed when price breaks out from the inside \nbar pattern and then quickly reverses to close within the range of the \nmother bar.  \nSee the illustration below:",

    "text": "aa.\n\nor coin.\nLet’s not digress and move directly to day trading. Understanding and using Risk Management and Position Sizing is literally the\nmost important thing you can do to improve your trading!\nWhen considering any trade, you need to know three different prices: • Your EntryPrice (the price you buy at) • Your Stop Loss Price (the price where you exit an unsuccessful trade) • Your Take Profit \nP rice (your target price where you will c\nl ose the trade) Managing risk means that in anytrade, your potential loss (or Risk) is limited to an amount that you determine in advance. The suggested Risk is 1% of trading capital per trade. Using a 1% Risk level protects your capital when you eventually run into a string of losing trades.If you lose on 5 consecutive trades, you’ve only lost 5% of your capital, which can be recovered quickly. New traders and those with a smaller amount of trading capital may be better off risking only 0.5%at first, while more experienced traders may risk as much as 3%. Anything greater than 3% Risk is not recommended. You manage Risk by using a Stop Loss order. The potential loss in a trade is determined by the difference between your Entry Price and your Stop Loss Price. The Stop Loss order limits your loss to whatever amount you already determined as your acceptable Risk (1% of your trading capital, for example). The level for your Stop Loss should always be derived from a proper analysis, and not by picking an arbitrary number. A Stop Loss order is designed to get you out of a bad trade with minimal loss of capital. Do not get discouraged if your Stop Loss gets hit! Its part of the plan, its expected and normal to get stopped out \nof a trade.\n•  We suggest that you do not enter more than 2 or 3 trades at a time. \nIt can be difficult to effectively manage more than 3 trades at once.\nWatch the Videos and Take Notes\nclick here",

The Order Book shows you the number of coins or tokens being offered at each price –this is also known as ‘market depth’. Buy orders are known as ‘Bids’, since you are bidding a price to buy an asset from someone. Sell orders are known as “Asks”, since you are asking someone to pay a certain price when selling your asset. Whenever a Bid meets an Ask, a trade is completed. In the image below, the Order Book is the list of prices along the left side. The Depth Chart on the right is simply the visual picture of the orders in the Order Book.

So you answer all of these questions in advance:\n1.What’s your goal (get more Bitcoin, more Ethereum, more USD?)\n2.Why do you want to enter a trade – Which signals tell you that this price is going to go up (or down)?\n3.How far do you expect price to move at least?\n4.In which time frame do you expect price to move up (or down)?\n5.Where would be your entry price?\n6.Where would be your stop loss?\n7.What’s your hedging strategy?\n8.Where do you take profit?\nWith these parameters you are able to execute a trade, from the beginning to the end. \nOtherwise you don’t know what you are doing and probably end up with no profit or even a loss.\nKnowing What Trading Is Not:\nJust buying somewhere, where price looks relatively low, without precise entry plan would be investing and not \ntrading.\nInvestments should be done based on fundamentals: \nYou should know exactly why you expect a cryptocurrency to gain value over time and why it shouldn‘t just disappear \nat some point.\nKeep in mind that there is a big competition between those hundreds of altcoins which are just slightly adjusted \nclones of each other in many cases, or at least very similar concepts.\nMost likely few of them will survive in the longrun.

    "text": "Divergence Trading\n\nClick here for video <=\n\nWhat if there was a low risk way to sell near the top or buy near the bottom of a trend?\n\nWhat if you were already in a long position and you could know ahead of time the perfect place to exit instead\nof watching all your unrealized gains vanish before your eyes because your trade reverses direction?\n\nWhat if you believe a currency pair will continue to fall but would like to go short at a better price or a less risky\nentry?\n\nWell there is a way. It’s called divergence trading.\n\nDivergence is basically price action measured in relationship to an oscillator indicator. It doesn't really matter\nwhat type of oscillator you use. You can use RSI, Stochastic, MACD, CCl, etc. etc. The great thing about\ndivergences is that you can use them as a leading indicator and after some practice, it’s not too difficult to\nspot.\n\nWhen traded properly, you can be consistently profitable with divergences. The best thing about divergences\n\nis that since you're usually buying near the bottom or selling near the top, your risk on your trades are very\nsmall relative to your potential reward. Cha ching!\n\nHigher Highs and Lower Lows\n\nJust think “higher highs” and “lower lows”. If price is making highs, the oscillator should also be making higher\nhighs. If price is making lower lows, the oscillator should also be making lower lows.\n\nlf they are NOT, that means price and the oscillator are diverging from each other. Hence the term,\ndivergence.\n\nDivergences act as an early warning system alerting you when the market could reverse. For example, if bulls\nhave steadily pushed EUR/USD higher, the appearance of divergence between price and indicator could\nmean that bulls are running out of gas and price will soon fall\n\nPlease keep in mind that | use divergence as an indicator, not a signal to enter a trade! It wouldn't be smart to\ntrade basely solely on divergences as too many false signals are given. It’s not 100% foolproof, but when\nused as a setup condition and combined with additional confirmation tools, your trades have a high probability\nof winning with relatively low risk.\n\nOn the flip side, | think it is just as dangerous trade against this indicator. If you're unsure about which direction\nto trade, chill out on the sidelines.\n\nDivergences don't appear that often, but when they do appear, it'd behoove you to pay attention. Regular\ndivergences can help you collect a big chunk of profit because you're able to get in right when the trend\nchanges. Hidden divergences can help you ride a trade longer resulting in bigger-than-expected profits by\nkeeping you on the correct side of a trend.\n\nThe trick is to train your eye to spot divergences when they appear AND choose the proper divergences to\n\ntrade. Just because you see a divergence, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should automatically jump in with a\nposition. Cherry pick your setups and you'll do well.\n\n¢ Regular divergences = signal possible trend reversal\n\n¢ Hidden divergences = signal possible trend continuation\n\nWhat is a swing?\nSwings are pivot points, you want to use clearly defined swings for divergences.\nWhen drawing patterns you want to use swings as touchpoints.\n\nSwing highs weceeeeses- e",

    "text": "Factors that can be included while determining day trading crypto strategies:\n#1 Volume\nBy trading volume, you can understand the popularity of particular crypto, \nand the amount of activity that happens around that coin or token. \nA cryptocurrency must have considerable volume for day trading. \nA good trading volume is an indication of a healthy investment. \nCryptocurrency trading volume is determined by the number of trades. \nThe higher the number of trades, the better the volume.\n#2 Volatility\nVolatility refers to the price fluctuation, that is predominant in the cryptocurrency market which means \nthe digital asset can be either a success or a failure for the trader. \nFor day trading, one should choose a cryptocurrency with upward price volatility \nso that you can make a profit as and when it spikes.\nIt is not unusual for a coin price to fluctuate by 10-50% in a day.\n#3 Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nYou must remember that the crypto you choose must be supported by the reputable exchanges.\nMostly the day traders store their asset in cryptocurrency exchanges which is quite risky, \nso the security is high. \nYou must look out for the number of coins listed on the exchange along with transparency and transaction fees.\n#4 Recent News\nNews can affect any industry and if it's good, the prices might rise and vice versa. \nCryptocurrency industry is sensitive to negative news as it is not regulated, unlike fiat currencies. \nPopularity and impressions play an important role in the cryptocurrency industry as its being managed \nby people all across the world.\n#5 Active Team\nFor any crypto project success, you must see how active the team is! \nThe more they are active, the more prompt they can be in answering your queries.\nA strong and active team is helpful as they send regular updates regarding the particular token or coin.\nLet’s not digress and move directly to day trading. \nUnderstanding and using Risk Management and Position Sizing is literally the\nmost important thing you can do to improve your trading!\nWhen considering any trade, you need to know three different prices: \n• Your Entry Price (the price you buy at) \n• Your Stop Loss Price (the price where you exit an unsuccessful trade) \n• Your Take Profit Price (your target price where you will close the trade) \nManaging risk means that in any trade, your potential loss (or Risk) is limited to an amount that you determine in \nadvance. \nThe suggested Risk is 1% of trading capital per trade. \nUsing a 1% Risk level protects your capital when you eventually run into a string of losing trades.\nIf you lose on 5 consecutive trades, you’ve only lost 5% of your capital, \nwhich can be recovered quickly. \nNew traders and those with a smaller amount of trading capital may be better off risking only 0.5% at first, while \nmore experienced traders may risk as much as 3%. \nAnything greater than 3% Risk is not recommended. \nYou manage Risk by using a Stop Loss order. \nThe potential loss in a trade is determined by the difference between your Entry Price and \nyour Stop Loss Price. \nThe Stop Loss order limits your loss to whatever amount you already determined as your acceptable Risk (1% of \nyour trading capital, for example). \nThe level for your Stop Loss should always be derived from a proper analysis, and not by picking an arbitrary \nnumber. \nA Stop Loss order is designed to get you out of a bad trade with minimal loss of capital. \nDo not get discouraged if your Stop Loss gets hit! Its part of the plan, its expected and normal to get stopped out \nof a trade.\n•  We suggest that you do not enter more than 2 or 3 trades at a time. \nIt can be difficult to effectively manage more than 3 trades at once.",

Either it breaks out upwards from a recent low\n\nprice area (support area), or it breaks down from a recent high price area (resistance zone).\n\nThe strategy is to buy at a point where the new uptrend seems confirmed.\n\nSo it‘s more likely not just a fakeout which falls back to the bottom but really the beginning of an uptrend.\nWhen you find a breakout like in the example below, wait for confirmation of the breakout.\n\nWhat we want to see is a higher low which stays above the last resistance zone (illustrated by our black line).\n\n&) Siacoin / Bitcoin, 240, POLONIEX\n\n©0.00000088 H0.00000094 L0.00000087 C0.00000094\nVol (20) 71M 176M\n\nprice should stay\nabove resistance to\nshow a real breakout\n\n‘@ wait for the further move up\n‘4 above resistance\n\n(when resistance\nturned into support)\n\na ee ese\n\n€ Notice enhanced volume\n\n27 29 Dec 4 6 8 1 13 15\n\nThe breakout seems confirmed when price stays above the recent resistance, which should turn into support.\n\nThe confirmation is even stronger when we get a second higher low.\n\n© EOS / Bitcoin, 240, BITFINEX ©.0.00033165-H.0.00035370- L0.00032991 €0.00034421\n\nVol (20) 623K 751K\nNha\nPrice stayed above new support level\nh and has passed 2. higher low\n! ! %h = buy signal\n— 2. higher low\nvy —— 1. higher low\nane * sre escesedbecuestDiovensssneeeaees Notice how resistance\nhi \\ pars turned into support\nBLM naiivr, f\nNauthtiga yf na\n—— low\nne ne volume zone > p>\nee ee\n16 23 27 Nov 13\n\n20 27 Dec 5",

    "text": "Divergence Trading\n\nWhat if there was a low risk way to sell near the top or buy near the bottom of a trend?\n\nWhat if you were already in a long position and you could know ahead of time the perfect place to exit instead\nof watching all your unrealized gains vanish before your eyes because your trade reverses direction?\n\nWhat if you believe a currency pair will continue to fall but would like to go short at a better price or a less risky\nentry?\n\nWell there is a way. It’s called divergence trading.\n\nDivergence is basically price action measured in relationship to an oscillator indicator. It doesn't really matter\nwhat type of oscillator you use. You can use RSI, Stochastic, MACD, CCl, etc. etc. The great thing about\ndivergences is that you can use them as a leading indicator and after some practice, it’s not too difficult to\nspot.\n\nWhen traded properly, you can be consistently profitable with divergences. The best thing about divergences\n\nis that since you're usually buying near the bottom or selling near the top, your risk on your trades are very\nsmall relative to your potential reward. Cha ching!\n\nHigher Highs and Lower Lows\n\nJust think “higher highs” and “lower lows”. If price is making highs, the oscillator should also be making higher\nhighs. If price is making lower lows, the oscillator should also be making lower lows.\n\nlf they are NOT, that means price and the oscillator are diverging from each other. Hence the term,\ndivergence.\n\nDivergences act as an early warning system alerting you when the market could reverse. For example, if bulls\nhave steadily pushed EUR/USD higher, the appearance of divergence between price and indicator could\nmean that bulls are running out of gas and price will soon fall\n\nPlease keep in mind that | use divergence as an indicator, not a signal to enter a trade! It wouldn't be smart to\ntrade basely solely on divergences as too many false signals are given. It’s not 100% foolproof, but when\nused as a setup condition and combined with additional confirmation tools, your trades have a high probability\nof winning with relatively low risk.\n\nOn the flip side, | think it is just as dangerous trade against this indicator. If you're unsure about which direction\nto trade, chill out on the sidelines.\n\nDivergences don't appear that often, but when they do appear, it'd behoove you to pay attention. Regular\ndivergences can help you collect a big chunk of profit because you're able to get in right when the trend\nchanges. Hidden divergences can help you ride a trade longer resulting in bigger-than-expected profits by\nkeeping you on the correct side of a trend.\n\nThe trick is to train your eye to spot divergences when they appear AND choose the proper divergences to\ntrade. Just because you see a divergence, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should automatically jump in with a\nposition. Cherry pick your setups and you'll do well.\n\n¢ Regular divergences = signal possible trend reversal\n\n¢ Hidden divergences = signal possible trend continuation",

    "text": "A List Of The Most\nImportant Price \nAction Patterns\n\nTo be a price action trader means having a deep understanding of the various \ndifferent price action patterns that form in the market. The problem with these \npattern, is that because there are so many of them that form in the market, \nknowing which ones you should take the time out to learn and which you should \nleave can be quite challenging. To solve this problem, I thought that today I \nwould give you a list of what I believe to be the most important price action \npatterns you need to learn as a forex trader.\nAs some of you reading this will probably already know, there are three basic \ntypes of pattern that can form in the market:\n• Price Action Reversal Patterns\n• Price Action Continuation Patterns\n• Price Action Candlestick Pattern\nI'll begin today's article by first showing you what the most important price action \nreversal patterns are, followed by which continuation patterns you need to have \nknowledge on, and finally I'll show you the two most important price action \ncandlestick patterns you need to watch out for in the market.\nPrice Action Reversal Patterns\nReversal patterns are probably the most important set of price action patterns \nyou need to really have a deep understanding of, as they can give you early \nclues about if a movement in the market is coming to an end. The six patterns \nI'm going to be showing you in this section are all multi-swing shape patterns, \nwhich means that each one of the patterns forms from more than one upswing \nand downswing taking place in the market, and they all look similar to common \nshapes upon their completion.\nThe Head And Shoulders Pattern\nThe first price action reversal pattern we're going to look at is the head and \nshoulders pattern. Without doubt one of the most popular and well known price \naction patterns in the market, the head and shoulders formation is one which all \nprice action traders need to memorize and understand if they want to become \ngood at spotting reversals using price action. As you've probably already \nguessed, the head and shoulders pattern is a reversal pattern which has a swing\nstructure very similar to that of person's head and shoulders.",

    "text": "Here's an image of a bearish head and shoulders pattern which formed on the \n1hour chart of EUR/USD.\nYou can see from the image the structure of the pattern does bear a striking \nresemblance to somebody standing up with their head straight and their \nshoulders level with one another. Most head and shoulders patterns are \nsupposed to look like the one you can see in the image above, but a large \npercentage of them will actually have features which are a little different from one\nanother. For example, you might see a pattern form with one of the shoulders \nbeing a little bit higher than the other, or the distance of two shoulders from the \nhead will be smaller or bigger than what you can see in the pattern above.\nThese small differences do not alter the pattern in any meaningful way. So long \nas the head is always found in the middle and the two shoulders are found to be \neither side, it's a head and shoulder pattern. If the high of the right shoulder is \nfound to be below the swing low of the move up which created the head, then it's\nnot a head and shoulders pattern and should not be treated as such.\nThe pattern itself comes in two variations. The one we just looked at in the image\nabove is referred to as being a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which is a \nsignal the market may reverse to the downside, whilst the one seen in the image \nbelow is a bullish head and shoulders pattern, but is often refereed to as being \nan inverse head and shoulders pattern due to the way the pattern is basically an \nupside down version of the bearish pattern.",

Instead of the head pointing upwards like \nit does with the bearish pattern it points down, as do the left and right shoulders. \nThe only real difference between the two patterns is in what needs to happen in \norder for the pattern to become invalidated. \nWith the bullish head and shoulders pattern if the right shoulder forms below the \nswing low of the move up which created the head, the pattern is not a head and \nshoulders and is instead some other formation. The bearish head and shoulders \nfollows the same rule, only the right shoulder cannot form above the swing high \nof the move down which created the head, if it does it's not a bearish head and \nshoulders pattern.\nAll in all the head and shoulders formation is usually quite a reliable signal the \ncurrent movement is going to reverse.

The swing low that forms at the bottom of \nthe swing higher is one of the two bottoms that forms during the pattern. The \nnext swing low and bottom will always end up forming at a similar point to where \nthis first swing low has formed, and the overall swing structure will usually \nresemble that of the letter W once the pattern has fully formed.",

    "text": "In this image we are looking at an example of the double top pattern.\nThe double top is of course the opposite to the double bottom, which means that \nit's formation involves two upswings taking place with swing highs forming at \nsimilar prices to one another instead of two swing lows. \nBoth patterns become invalidated if the second top or bottom in each respective \npattern forms at a price which is far away from the price at which the first top or \nbottom has formed at. There isn't any exact guidelines on how far away this \nshould be, but I'd say that if you see two or three large candlesticks close below \nthe first bottom or above the first top, then it's probably not a double bottom or \ndouble top pattern.\nOverall the double bottom and double top patterns are two decent reversal \nformations, although they can be quite difficult patterns to trade effectively, due to\nthe way the swing seen after the second bottom or top has formed can easily \nturn into a retracement or consolidation soon after you would have entered a \ntrade.\nThe Rising And Falling Wedge Pattern\nThe final two price action reversal patterns we're going to look at, are the rising \nwedge and the falling wedge. The rising and falling wedges are two patterns \nwhich get their name from the way the market sometimes contracts before the \nend of an up-move or down-move. The contraction of the swings is what creates \nthe wedge and gives the patterns their name.",

As the pattern \nprogresses though, the distance between the two lines becomes smaller and \nsmaller until eventually the two lines are really close to one another, almost as if \nthey were about to form the tip on an arrow head.\nIn this image we're looking at an example of a falling wedge pattern.\nThe falling wedge is the bullish version of the wedge pattern and is always a \nsignal the market may be about to reverse to the upside. It forms in much the \nsame way as the rising wedge pattern, with the only difference being that the \nswings contract to the downside rather than the upside like they do during the \nformation of the rising wedge.",

    "text": "In closing, the rising and falling wedges are two patterns which are important for \nyou to be able to recognize 0n a chart, but are not patterns which you should use\nto look for entries into trades, due to the way many false signals will appear as \nthe swings contract and the pattern nears completion.\nPrice Action Continuation Patterns\nSo now that we've had a look at some of the most important price action reversal\npatterns, I think it's time to move on and spend a little bit of time looking at the \nmost important price action continuation patterns you can expect to see form in \nthe market. Price action continuation patterns are basically the opposite of the \nreversal patterns we have just looked at. Instead of signalling to us a reversal is \ngoing to take place, their appearance is a sign the current trend/movement is \nprobably going to continue.\nThe Rising And Falling Wedge Continuation\nWhilst the rising and falling wedges are most often found to be price action \nreversal patterns, they can also be continuation patterns if they happen to form \nduring downtrends and up-trends respectively.\nHere's a falling wedge pattern which formed during a retracement that was taking\nplace during an up-swing on EUR/USD.\nThe reversal formation of the falling wedge will always form at the end of \ndowntrends or down-moves, but the continuation variation will only form during \nup-trends and up-moves. You can see the wedge forms in the same way as it \nwould if it was signalling a reversal at the end of a downtrend.",

If you see one form during an\nup-trend, it's not a continuation pattern and is instead the reversal pattern we just\nlooked at in the previous section.\nThe vast majority of the wedge continuation patterns you'll see form in the \nmarket will form as retracements during up or down moves. Their formation will \ntake place during the whole duration of the retracement, and the breakout seen \nat the end of each pattern will usually signal an end to not only the patterns \nformation, but the entire retracement itself.\nThe Bullish And Bearish Flag Pattern\nBullish and bearish flags (sometimes pronounced bull flag and bear flag) are two \nmore really common price action continuation patterns you'll see forming in the \nmarket. They get their name from the way the structure of the pattern resembles \nthat of flag mounted on top of a pole.",

    "text": "In the image above you can see an example of a bullish flag pattern that formed \non AUD/USD.\nYou can see the pattern is basically constructed off of two points. The first point \nis the sharp bullish move higher which takes place right before retracement \nbegins (this is refereed to as being the pole of the flag) and the second point is \nthe retracement itself. The retracement is the flag part of the pattern and should \nalways terminate before reaching the 50% fibonacci retracement level of the \ndownswing which creates the flag pole. If you see the market retrace beyond the \n50% level it's usually a sign the pattern is changing from a flag into something \nelse.\n\nThis image shows a bearish flag pattern which formed on the 1hour chart \nEUR/USD.\nThe bearish flag is basically an upside down version of the bullish flag. Both \npatterns form in the exact same way and they both abide by the same rules \nregarding their formation i.e if the market moves beyond the 50% level of the flag\npole swing the probability of pattern remaining a flag decreases dramatically.\nBoth bull flags and bear flags form frequently in the market and are often quite a \nreliable signal the current movement is going to continue. Usually the point \nwhere a flag will terminate is the same point as where a supply or demand zone \nhas formed. So if you want to try to get an entry into a flag pattern trade, it's best \nto do so around the point where a nearby supply or demand zone has formed, as\nthis is point where the flag is likely to end and cause the prior trend/movement to \nresume.\nThe Descending And Descending Triangle Patterns\nThe last couple of continuation patterns we're going to have a look at are the \nascending triangle and the descending triangle. Triangle patterns are very much \nlike the rising and falling wedge patterns we looked at earlier. They form in the \nsame way and have a similar swing structure to one another. \nThe main difference between the two, is that the two triangle patterns always \nform with one straight edge that acts as a resistance or support level until the \nmarket breaks out of the pattern and continues to move in the direction of the \nprior trend.",

The straight edge of the ascending triangle is \na support level, and this level stops the market from moving lower during the time\nthe pattern is forming.\nIn this image you can see a descending triangle pattern which formed on the \n1hour chart of AUD/USD.\nThe descending triangle is the bearish version of the triangle pattern and it's \nformation is a sign the current down-move/downtrend is likely going to continue. \nThe only difference it has with the ascending triangle is that it's straight edge is a \nresistance level which stops prices from rising higher during the formation of the \npattern in the market.\nThe ascending and descending triangle patterns are good to know but not that \ngreat for trading, due to the way a few false breakouts will usually take place \nbefore the real breakout occurs and causes the market to move in the direction it \nwas moving in prior to the pattern forming in the market.\nPrice Action Candlestick Patterns\nThe final set of price action patterns we're going to to be looking at today are \nprice action candlestick patterns. There are lots of candlestick patterns out there,\nbut I just want to focus on the two which I think are most important for price \naction traders to understand.",

    "text": "Pin Bar/Hammer Candlestick\nThe pin bar is a single candle pattern which can be found forming across all \ncurrencies and all time-frames in the market. It falls into the category of price \naction reversal patterns due the fact it's appearance is supposed to be a signal a \nreversal is going to occur. Although it must be said that very few pin bars actually\ncause large reversals to take place in the market, (I'll explain why in a minute).\nLike most price action patterns the pin bar comes in two varieties:\nThe bullish pin bar, which signals a reversal to the upside may be about to take \nplace, and the bearish pin bar, which is a sign a reversal to the downside is \nprobably going to occur.\nHere's an image of some bullish pin bars which formed on the 1 hour chart of \nEUR/USD\nYou can see that the vast majority of these bullish pins did cause the market to \nreverse once they had formed, but they didn't all cause it to reverse for the same \nduration of time. Some caused large upswings to take place whilst others only \ncreated small retracements.",

    "text": "In this image we can see some bearish pin bars that formed on the 1 hour chart of \nUSD/JPY.\nAgain, you can see that the pin bars which formed on here also caused reversals of \nvarying sizes to take place. The reason why pin bars cause different sized reversals to \noccur, is because of the action that caused the pin bar to form in the first place. Pin \nbars and all the other candlesticks you see forming on your charts, form as a result of \ntraders making decisions in regards to the market price. Pin bars happen to form \nexclusively from the bank traders either placing trades because they want to make the \nmarket reverse, or from taking profits off trades which they've already got placed.\nThe reversal created by the pin bar which has formed as a result of the bank traders \ntaking profits off their trades, is naturally much smaller than the reversal caused by the \npin which has formed from the bank traders placing trades to make the market reverse.\nIt's obvious why this is, I mean if you took some profits off a trade you would want the \nmarket to continue moving in the direction to which your trade had been placed so you \ncould make more money from the trade. The bank traders want the same to happen \nwhen they cause a pin bar to form from taking profits off their own trades, which is why\nthe reversal caused by some pin bars forming are much smaller than the reversals \ncaused by other pins forming.\nBullish and bearish pin bars are really good reversal patterns to watch out for if you're \na price action trader, but they must be traded in the right way and you must understand\nwhy they form in the market. Most of the books and guides out there on pin bars do not\nteach traders what causes them to form, when it's knowing what causes them to form \nthat will allow you to determine which pins have a high probability of working out \nsuccessfully.",

Like the pin bar the engulfing candle is a \nreversal pattern, which means that a reversal is supposed to take place immediately \nafter you see one form in the market. Unlike the pin bar the engulfing candlestick is a \ntwo bar reversal pattern, a pattern which requires there to be two candlesticks present \nin order for it's formation to be complete.\nHere's an example of a bearish engulfing candle which caused a reversal to \noccur on EUR/USD.\nThe formation of a bearish engulf is always a signal that a reversal to the \ndownside is about to take place. The pattern itself consists of two candlesticks. \nThe bearish engulfing candlestick itself, which I've marked with an arrow, and the\nbullish candlestick that formed an hour before. The bullish candle is first candle \nrequired in the bearish engulf setup. This is the candlestick which the market will \nalways engulf with a bearish candle immediately after it's formation.",

    "text": "In order for a bearish engulfing candle to form, a bullish candle must have \nformed immediately prior. You can't have a bearish candlestick engulfing another \nbearish candle, it has t0 be a bullish candle in order for it to be a bearish engulf.\nHere you can see an image of a bullish engulfing setup which caused a reversal \non EUR/USD.\nBullish engulfing candlesticks are of course the opposite to bearish engulfing \ncandles, which means their appearance is a sign the market is going to reverse \nto the upside. Like the bearish engulfing candle they are also a two bar pattern, \nbut instead of the first candle in the pattern being a bullish candlestick, like we \nsee with the bearish engulfing formation, the first candle in a bullish engulfing \nsetup will always engulf a bearish candle. A bullish engulfing candle cannot \nengulf another bullish candle, it can only engulf bearish candles.\nEngulfing candlesticks are best used as signals to enter trades at pre-existing \npoints where you expect the market to reverse, such as support and resistance \nlevels or supply and demand zones. They can be traded on their own without any\nother confirming factors being present, but in my opinion they don't tend to work \nout as well as pin bars do.\nSummary\nWhilst the patterns I've talked about in this article aren't all the price action \npatterns that can form in the market, they are the ones which are the most \nimportant, and you should really take some time out to study these patterns on \nyour own. It would be a good idea to go back on your charts and look for times \nwhen these patterns have appeared in the market and watch to see how they",

It was, after all, a level playing field, a negative-sum game with some-\nbody winning and somebody losing. (Hint: The winner is always the broker.)\nAll one had to do to win was pick stocks that went up and avoid stocks that\nwent down. Easy.\nI kept this in mind when I graduated from Syracuse University with an\nengineering degree and showed up early for my first professional job. Each\nmorning I cracked open the newspaper and plotted my stock picks on a piece\nof graph paper taped to the wall. Bob, my office mate, used the same newspa-\nper to select his stocks. I chose my selections after exhausting fundamental\nresearch, but Bob simply closed his eyes, twirled his hand around, and plunged\nhis finger into the newspaper. When he opened his eyes and removed his fin-\nger, he announced another pick.\nAfter several months of tracking both our selections, I made a startling\ndiscovery: I was getting creamed. Bob’s random selections were beating the tar\nout of my carefully researched choices. I also discovered something else: I was\nlearning a lot by paper trading.\nWith the hesitancy and distrust inherited from my parents, I studied two\ndozen firms before making my final selection and first purchase: I opened a\nmoney market account. The timing was excellent; I was earning over 17% on\nmy cash. At first glance, the return might imply a very risky investment but it\nwas not. The prime rate was, after all, at 21%.\nFlush with success, I gathered my courage and opened a brokerage\naccount and began investing the few pennies I saved. Again, the timing was\nexcellent as I caught the beginning of a major bull market. I bought a stock at\na split-adjusted price of 88 cents and watched it go to $30 and change.\nLest you think that everything was easy, consider what happened. My\nstock portfolio was growing by leaps and bounds, but my professional career\nwas about to take a turn for the worse. After switching careers more often than",

    "text": "I sometimes like to admit, I landed a job with a company I could finally call\nhome—a job that would last a lifetime, or so I hoped. Almost 6 months after\nmy 10-year anniversary with the company, I received a letter from the chair-\nman. He congratulated me on my decade with the company and looked for-\nward to even more success for me in the coming years.\nSix weeks later I was laid off.\nI took stock of the situation and decided that, at the age of 36, I had\nenough. Newspapers term guys like me The Missing Million. We are the ones\nwho, for whatever reason, leave their jobs and decide not to go back into the\nworkforce. We retire. Everyone, and I mean everyone (with the notable excep-\ntion of my cousin Mary Ann—bless her heart), thinks we are nuts. They are\nright, of course!\nFor the longest time, I have been fascinated with technical analysis of\nstocks. In the early years, I considered the little squiggles to be nothing short\nof voodoo. Still, I was curious as to why the major brokerage houses were hir-\ning technical analysts in droves. But I did not dare take my eye off the funda-\nmentals simply because I did not know anything about the technicals. Then I\ndiscovered Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine. During my\nlunch hour, I would take the elevator down to the library and read back issues.\nAlthough I saw chart patterns in the stocks I bought, I never really attached\nmuch significance to them. As some of my selections went sour, I began to view\nchart patterns with more respect. The fundamentals always looked good, but\nthe technicals were signaling a trend change just as I was about to pull the trig-\nger. The stocks I bought either lost money outright or I sold them too soon\nand cut my profits short.\nPerhaps this has happened to you. You do fundamental research on a stock\nand then buy it, only to watch it go nowhere for a year or more. Even worse,\nonce you get in, the stock tumbles. Had you looked at the chart the answer was\nalways there. Prices pierced a trend line, a head-and-shoulders top appeared\nout of nowhere, the relative strength index signaled an overbought situation. In\nshort, any number of technical indicators were screaming that a buy now\nwould cost you your shirt. But you never saw the signs.\nYou are not alone; I did the same thing for years. I eventually got so frus-\ntrated with the performance of my stock selections that I decided to do my own\nresearch on technical analysis. I went to the library and read the same thing in\nmany books: A head-and-shoulders formation works most of the time. What\ndoes that mean? Does it mean they are successful 51% of the time or 90% of\nthe time? No one had the answer. I was not willing to risk my hard-earned dol-\nlars on simple bromides. As an engineer I wanted hard, cold facts, not fuzzy\nplatitudes. So, I wrote this book.\nAt the back of the book is an Index of Chart Patterns.

Page numbers beside each pattern\ndirect you to the associated chapter.\nThe chapters are arranged alphabetically in two sections; chart patterns\nand event patterns. Within each chapter, you are first greeted with a “Results\nSnapshot” of the major findings followed by a short discussion. Then, a\n“Tour” invites you to explore the chart pattern. “Identification Guidelines,” in\nboth table form and in-depth discussion, make selecting and verifying your\nchoices easier.\nNo work would be complete without an exploration of the mistakes, and\nthe “Focus on Failures” section dissects the cause of failures. The all-important\n“Statistics” section follows. How do you trade a chart pattern? That is what the\n“Trading Tactics” and “Sample Trade” sections explore. The “For Best Per-\nformance” section includes a list of tips and observations on how to select bet-\nter performing patterns.\nIf you have ever worked on a car or done some woodworking, then you\nwill recognize the importance of selecting the right tool for the job. You would\nnot want to use a flat-head screwdriver when a Phillips works better. Both do\nthe job but they are hardly interchangeable. Sometimes it is not a screwdriver\nyou should be using, but a chisel. Selecting the proper tools and knowing how\nto use them is half the battle. This book is a lot like that, helping to sort the\nwheat from the chaff. Sometimes a chart pattern is frightening enough that you\nwill want to take profits. At other times, the best trade that you can make is\nnone at all.\nI cannot give you the experience needed to make money in the stock mar-\nket using chart patterns. I can only give you the tools and say, “Go to work on\npaper first.” That is the first step in developing a trading style that works for\nyou, one you are comfortable with, one that improves as you do. If you review\nyour paper trades, you will understand why a stop-loss order is more than a\ntool for the professionals. You will improve your ability to predict support and\nresistance levels that will, in turn, allow you to tighten your stops and get out\nnear the top, cut your losses short, and let your profits run. You will under-\nstand why the statistics in this book are useful for comparison purposes, but\nyour trading results may fall short. You may discover that your girlfriend loves\ndiamonds, but as a chart pattern, they are a lousy investment. One word says it\nall. Experience.\nGood luck.\nTHOMAS N.

Much to my surprise and\ndelight, the editor at the time, Thom Hartle, published the work. That single\nevent sent me spinning off in a new direction, another career.\nNearly a dozen articles later, I called Thom and chatted with him about\nan idea for a book. He steered me to Pamela van Giessen, now editorial direc-\ntor for John Wiley & Sons, Inc., publisher of this book. A single e-mail of my\nidea to her put a new set of wheels in motion. Simple words cannot express my\nthanks to these two outstanding individuals.\nThis is a great book made better by the tireless efforts of Bernice Pettinato\nof Beehive Production Services. She did more than shepherd a 2,000 page man-\nuscript through production. She read it and edited it without dying of boredom\nwhile making astute suggestions. Simply, she’s the best.

He decides it is time to take\noff the gloves: JCB goes public. He uses the money from the initial public\noffering to buy his competitor and add a few more stores around town.\nWith a growing sales base, Jim’s clout allows him to negotiate lower\nprices for the office supplies he is retailing. He passes on part of the savings to\nhis customers, while watching his margins widen, and plows the profits back\ninto building more stores.\nJim calls his friend, Tom, and tells him of his plans to expand the opera-\ntion statewide. They chat for a while and exchange business tactics on how best\nto manage the expansion. When Tom gets off the phone, he decides to con-\nduct his own research on JCB. He visits several stores and sees the same thing:\npacked parking lots, people bustling around with full shopping carts, and lines\nat the checkout counters. He questions a few customers to get a sense of the\ndemographics. At a few stores, he even chats with suppliers as they unload their\nwares. Back at the office, he does a thorough analysis of the financials and\nlooks at the competition. Everything checks out so he orders his trading part-\nners to buy the stock at no higher than 10.\nWhen news of the expansion plan hits the wires, the Street panics. It is,\nafter all, a soft economy and expanding willy-nilly when a recession looms is\ndaft, maybe even criminal, according to the pundits. The stock drops below 10\nand Tom’s crew makes its move. They buy as much as they can without rais-\ning suspicion. The stock rises anyway. It goes back up to 11, then 12, and\nrounds over at 13 before heading back down.",

    "text": "Several months go by and the economic outlook is as bleak as ever. The\nstock eases down to 9. After Tom checks in with Jim for the latest public news,\nTom’s team buys more. It is an easy score because investors are willing to\ndump the stock, especially as year-end tax selling approaches.\nSix weeks later the company releases the sales numbers for JCB; they are\nbetter than expected. The stock rises 15% in minutes and closes at 10.75. And that\nis just for starters. Six months later, it’s clear the economy was never in danger of\nentering a recession and everyone sees boom times ahead. The stock hits 20.\nYears go by, the stock splits a few times, and the holiday season looms.\nTom interviews a handful of customers leaving JCB Superstores and discovers\nthat they are all complaining about the same thing: The advertised goods are\nnot on the shelves. Tom investigates further and discovers a massive distribu-\ntion problem, right at the height of the selling season. JCB has overextended\nitself; the infrastructure is simply not there to support the addition of one new\nstore each week.\nTom realizes it is time to sell. He tells his trading department to dump\nthe stock immediately but for no less than 28.25. They liquidate about a third\nof their large holdings before driving the stock down below the minimum.\nSince it is the holidays, everyone seems to be in a buying mood. Novice\ninvestors jump in at what they consider a bargain price. The major brokerage\nhouses climb aboard and tout the stock, but Tom knows better. When the\nstock recovers to its old high, his trading partners sell the remainder of their\nholdings. The stock tops out and rounds over. During the next month and a\nhalf, the stock drifts down, slowly, casually. There does not appear to be a rush\nfor the exits—just a slow trickle as the smart money quietly folds up shop.\nThen news of poor holiday sales leaks out. There is a rumor about distri-\nbution problems, merchandising mistakes, and cash flow problems. Brokerage\nfirms that only weeks before were touting the stock now advise their clients to\nsell. The stock plummets 39% overnight.\nOne or two analysts say the stock is oversold; it is a bargain and investors\nshould add to their positions. Many bottom fishers follow their brokers’ rec-\nommendation and buy the stock. Big mistake. The buying enthusiasm pushes\nthe price up briefly before a new round of selling takes hold. Each day the stock\ndrops a bit lower, nibbling away like waves washing against a castle of sand. In\n2 months’ time, the stock is down another 30%.\nThe following quarter JCB Superstores announces that earnings will\nlikely come in well below consensus estimates. The stock drops another 15%.\nThe company is trying to correct the distribution problem, but it is not some-\nthing easily fixed. It decides to stop expanding and to concentrate on the prof-\nitability of its existing store base.\nTwo years later, Tom pulls up the stock chart. The dog has been flat for\nso long it looks as if its heartbeat has stopped. He calls Jim and chats about the\noutlook for JCB Superstores. Jim gushes enthusiastically about a new retailing\nconcept called the Internet. He is excited about the opportunity to sell office\n2\nIntroduction",

Tom is impressed, so he starts doing his homework and is soon buy-\ning the stock again.\nInvestment Footprints\nIf you picture in your mind the price action of JCB Superstores, you may rec-\nognize three chart patterns: a double bottom, a double top, and a dead-cat\nbounce. To knowledgeable investors, chart patterns are not squiggles on a\nprice chart; they are the footprints of the smart money. The footprints are all\nthey need to follow as they line their pockets with greater and greater riches.\nTo others, such as Tom, it takes hard work and pavement pounding before\nthey dare take a position in a stock. They are the ones making the footprints.\nThey are the smart money that is setting the rules of the game—a game any-\none can play. It is called investing.\nWhether you choose to use technical analysis or fundamental analysis in\nyour trading decisions, it pays to know what the market is thinking. It pays to\nlook for the footprints. Those footprints may well steer you away from a cliff\nand get you out of a stock just in time. The feet that make those footprints are\nthe same ones that will kick you in the pants, waking you up to a promising\ninvestment opportunity.\nLet me tell you how I followed one trail of footprints. I sold my holdings\nin Alaska Air because I thought the stock was going down. Here is my note-\nbook entry: “9/6/2001. I put a stop at 31.50 this morning and it hit. The stock\nhas breeched a support level and with weakness in the economy and Septem-\nber/October upon us, it’s time to leave with a small loss [2.5%]. I should have\nbought at the breakout price [of an Eve & Adam double bottom]. The relative\nstrength index peaked twice and now is headed down, suggesting a sale, and the\ncommodity channel index says sell, too.”\nI sold the airline two trading days before the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\nFour days after trading resumed, the stock bottomed at 17.70, nearly half the\nprice at what I sold. The footprints did not lie; they led away from a cliff.\nThis book gives you the tools to spot the footprints, where they predict\nthe stock is heading, how far it will travel, and how reliable the trail you are fol-\nlowing really is. The tools will not make you rich; tools rarely do. But they are\ninstruments to greater wealth. Use them wisely.\nThe Database\nFor this book, I used several databases in which to search for chart patterns. The\nmain database consists of 500 stocks, each with durations of 5 years beginning\nThe Database\n3",

    "text": "from mid-1991. I included the 30 Dow Jones industrials and familiar names\nwith varying market capitalizations. Stocks included in the database needed \na heartbeat (that is, they were not unduly flat over the 5-year period) and \ndid not have consistently large intraday price swings (too thinly traded \nor volatile).\nI usually removed stocks that went below $1.00, assuming bankruptcy\nwas right around the corner. Most of the names in the database are popular\nAmerican companies that trade on the NYSE, AMEX, or Nasdaq. The numer-\nous illustrations accompanying each chapter give a representative sample of the\nstocks involved.\nTo capture the bear market of 2000–2002 and expand on the bull mar-\nket since 1996, I included two additional databases. The first uses about 200\nstocks that I follow daily. The other contains about 300 stocks that I no longer\nfollow but that have historical data of limited duration (some issues no \nlonger trade).\nFor rare chart patterns, I use all three databases and search from 1991 to\nthe most recent date available. For plentiful patterns, I use already found pat-\nterns and add those appearing during the bear market. Thus, the number of\nstocks I use to find patterns and the amount of historical price quotes varies.\nIn the first edition of this book, I used a combination of computerized\nalgorithms and manual searching to find chart patterns. The current edition\nincludes the 15,000 patterns from the first edition and others found manually\nsince then, for a total of more than 38,500 patterns.\nStock Performance from 1991 to 2004\nBefore reading about the various chart patterns in this book, it is wise to review\nthe performance of the stock market during the period. Figure I.1 shows a\nmonthly price chart of the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Beginning in\nmid-1991, you can see that the market moved up at a leisurely pace, pausing\nduring much of 1994, and then resuming the climb at a steeper angle in 1995.\nThe index stumbled in August 1998 and made lower lows for 2 more months\nbefore continuing upward, peaking in March 2000, and signaling an end to the\nbull market. The move capped a rise of 418% from the start of the period.\nAfter that, the downhill bear run began, reaching a low in October 2002, for a\ndecline measuring 51%. The index bounced once but made a higher low in\nMarch 2003, signaling a trend change. Thus, the October low marked the end\nof the bear market.\nWhat does all this mean? The bear market measures from March 24,\n2000, to October 10, 2002—about 2.5 years long. For data collection pur-\nposes, the bull market is everything else, about 11 years long. That covers the\nperiod I used to search for chart patterns in this edition.\n4\nIntroduction",

It gives you the\ntools to invest successfully. It suggests which chart patterns work best and which\nones to avoid. Whether you can make money using them is entirely up to you.\nI call this book an encyclopedia because that is how I use it. Whenever I\nsee a chart pattern forming in a stock I own, or am thinking of buying, I read\nthe applicable chapter. The information refreshes my memory about identifi-\ncation quirks, performance, and any tips on how I can get in sooner or more\nprofitably. Then I search for similar patterns in the same stock (using different\ntime scales), and if that does not work, I search for similar patterns in stocks in\nthe same industry. I look at them closely to determine if their secrets are\napplicable to the current situation. I try to learn from their mistakes.\nDeveloping an Investment Style\nThe question I am asked most often is, how do I develop an investment style? It is\nusually not asked like that. Most take a more direct approach: How do I make\nmoney trading stocks? When first asked this question, I stumbled over the\nanswer.

Another says it is not blue at all but green,\nwhile the third says it looks like a combination: blue-green. To each individ-\nual, blue looks like blue—just do not try to compare answers.\nDeveloping a trading style is a lot like that. It is an individual endeavor\nthat has a lot in common with experience. I cannot give you experience; I can\nonly suggest ways to acquire your own.\nIf you read a chapter on a bullish chart pattern and buy the first stock\nshowing the pattern in a bull market, you will probably be successful. The first\ntrade nearly always works for the novice, maybe even the second or third one,\ntoo. Eventually, though, someone is going to pull the rug out from under you\n(who knows, maybe it occurs on the first trade). You will make an investment in\na chart pattern and the trade will go bad. Maybe you will stumble across a herd\nof bad trades and get flattened. You might question your sanity, you might\nquestion God, but one thing is for certain: Your trading style is not working.\nMost people buy stocks like they buy fruit. They look at it, perhaps sniff\nit, and plunk down their money. We are not talking about $1.59 here. We are\ntalking about thousands of dollars for part ownership in a company.\nIf you have ever been a board member, you know what I am talking about.\nYou have a fiduciary responsibility to the people who elected or appointed you\nto that position. Not only should you study the material handed to you by the\nstaff, but you have to get out in the field and kick the tires. Do not assume that\nwhat the staff says is always correct or represents the best solution. Question\neverything but learn in the process and try to be helpful without being a pest\n(I always seem to fall into the pest category). As a shareholder—an owner of the\ncompany—should it be any different?\nOnce, I considered buying a position in a company showing an upward\nbreakout from a symmetrical triangle. My computer program told me the com-\npany is a member of the machinery industry and further research revealed that\nit makes refractory products. I continued doing research on the company until\nthe problem gnawing at me finally sank in. I did not have the slightest idea\nwhat a refractory product was. Despite my search for an answer, I was not get-\nting the sort of warm fuzzies I usually get when researching a possible invest-\nment. So, I passed it over. I am trading it on paper, sure, but not in real life.\nCall it the Peter Lynch Syndrome: Do not invest in anything you cannot\nunderstand or explain in a paragraph. Good advice.\nOf course, if you blindly invest in chart squiggles and it works for you,\nwho am I to tell you you are doing it wrong? The fact is, you are not. If you\nconsistently make money at it, then you have developed an investment style\nthat fits your personality. Good for you!\nMy investment style, as you might have guessed, combines fundamental\nanalysis, technical analysis, emotional analysis, and money management. Just\nbecause I rely on technical analysis does not mean I do not look at the price-\nto-earnings, price-to-sales, and other more esoteric ratios. Then there is the\n6\nIntroduction",

Three\ndays later, I will want to trade again. Why? Am I trading just because it feels\ngood to be finally back in the thick of things? Am I trading just because the sin-\ngle woman living nearby does not know I exist, and I am acting out my frus-\ntrations or trying to impress her with the size of my wallet? That is where\npaper trading comes in handy. I can experiment on new techniques without\ngetting burned. If I do the simulation accurately enough, my subconscious will\nnot know the difference, and I will learn a lot in the process.\nOnce I come to terms with any emotional issues, I look at money man-\nagement. How much can I realistically expect to make, and how much can I\nlose? What is the proper lot size to take? When should I add to my position?\nHow long will it take for the stock to reach my target and should I invest in a\nless promising but quicker candidate?\nInvesting using chart formations is an exercise in probability. If you play\nthe numbers long enough, you will win out. Sure, some of your investments\nwill fail, and you must learn to cut your losses before they get out of hand. But\nthe winners should serve you well, providing you let them ride. Just do not\nmake the mistake of watching a stock double or triple only to reverse course\nand drop back to where it started. Or worse.\nDay Traders, Position Traders, Buy-and-Hold Investors\nAs I was writing this book, I kept asking myself what is the time horizon for chart\npatterns? Are they best for day traders, position traders, or buy-and-hold\ninvestors? The answer I kept coming up with is: Yes! Chart formations can be\nprofitable for day traders—those people who are in and out of a trade during a\nsingle day. Many day traders have trading styles that depend on chart forma-\ntions, support, and resistance. They concentrate on reliable formations that\nquickly fulfill their measure rule predictions.\nFor position traders, those who hold the trade longer than a day but not\nforever, chart patterns offer convenient entry and exit signals. I put myself in\nthis category. If the trade goes bad, I am out quickly. If it is profitable, I see no\nneed to cut my profits short. When the gains plateau, or if the stock has moved\nabout all it is going to, I consider moving on. Like the day trader, I try to keep\ncash employed by buying formations that promise reliable returns and reach\nthe ultimate high quickly.\nFor the long-term investor, chart patterns also signal good entry and exit\npoints. I remember buying an oil services company knowing that the invest-\nment would not make a significant return for 2 or 3 years. (I was wrong: It dou-\nbled in 3 weeks) I believe that in 3 years’ time, the stock will be in the 30s, a\nsixfold increase from its low. It probably will not qualify as a ten-bagger, but it\nis not small change either. In the short term, the road is going to be rocky, and\nDay Traders, Position Traders, Buy-and-Hold Investors\n7",

Call it poetic license, but I\nhope they give you some ideas on how to increase your profits or to minimize\nyour losses.\nStatistics: “I Don’t Believe the Numbers”\nA high, tight flag has an average rise of 69% in a bull market. Question: If you\ntrade this pattern often enough in a bull market, will you make an average of\n69%? Answer: No. Why not? Well, you may be like a friend of mine who has\ntraded stocks a dozen times but made money only once (a few hundred bucks).\nBut here is another reason: The 69% average rise represents 253 perfect trades.\nA perfect trade is one in which you buy at the breakout price and sell at the ulti-\nmate high—the highest high before prices decline by at least 20%. Not only\nare the trades perfect, but also commissions are not included. Your return may\nbe lower . . . or higher. However, I used the same spreadsheet formulas from\npattern to pattern, so you can compare performance in most cases (the excep-\ntions: flags, measured moves, and pennants) without worrying about whether\nyou believe the numbers.\n“If I reproduce your tests, will I get similar results?” Yes. A person in\nIndia I know is pulling 30%, 40%, and more out of the market on a consistent\nbasis. He would claim my statistics are too conservative! A hedge fund manager\nreports that my numbers for the dead-cat bounce are dead solid perfect.\nAnother says that while she was able to reproduce my dead-cat bounce num-\nbers, she was having trouble reproducing others. If you do not follow the\nmethods I used, your results will vary. Guaranteed. So, this edition includes a\nGlossary and Methodology chapter to explain how I measured each result.\nThe method I used opened a door to a new world. In this world, you will\nfind that a month after a breakout in a bear market, price often shows strength.\nYou will discover that when pullbacks occur, performance suffers. You will find\nthat failure rates start low but increase rapidly. Volume shapes, price gaps, pat-\ntern size, and a dozen other performance clues help some patterns but not oth-\ners. Findings like these are what make this book unique. The numbers tell a\nstory of fact that I share with you within the following pages.\n8\nIntroduction",

A broadening bottom has a price trend leading down to the start of\nthe formation; a broadening top has prices trending up. This differentiation is\nan arbitrary designation I made to separate the two formation types. I ignore\nbrief dips or rises a few days before the pattern as Figure 1.1 shows.\nSome maintain that a broadening bottom does not exist. They simply\nlump every broadening pattern into the broadening top category. I decided to\nseparate the two on the chance that their behavior differs.\nFigure 1.1 is an example of a broadening bottom. This particular one is\ncalled a five-point reversal because there are five alternating touches, two\n12\nBroadening Bottoms",

    "text": "Shape. The shape of the formation is distinct. It reminds me of chaos\ntheory where small disturbances oscillate back and forth, then grow un-\nbounded, wreaking havoc. In the stock market, price reaches a new high then\ncrosses over and makes a new low, creating the broadening pattern. When you\ndraw a trend line across the minor highs and another connecting the minor\nlows, the formation looks like a megaphone.\nTrend lines. The two trend lines drawn across the minor highs and lows\nare important. The top trend line should slope up; the bottom one should\nslope down. The diverging trend lines distinguish the broadening bottom from\nother types of formations, such as the right-angled broadening formation\n(which has one horizontal trend line) or the broadening wedge (both trend\nlines slope in the same direction). So it is important that each trend line has a\nslope that is opposite the other.\nTouches. A broadening bottom needs at least two minor highs and two\nminor lows to be a valid formation. Anything fewer means you are incorrectly\nidentifying the formation. What is a minor high or low? A minor high is when\nprices trend up, then drop back down, leaving a clearly defined peak. A minor\nlow is just the same thing flipped upside down: Prices move lower, then head\nback up leaving a clearly defined valley. Figure 1.1 shows five minor highs or\nlows, labeled by numbers. The odd numbers tag the minor highs and the even\nnumbers are the minor lows. Let me stress that the minor highs and lows need\nnot be alternating, as in Figure 1.1. Just as long as you can count at least two\npeaks and two valleys—wherever they may appear—that is fine.\nVolume. There is nothing magical in the volume trend. I performed lin-\near regression from the start of each formation to the end point (not the break-\nout point that is usually a month beyond the end of the formation) and found\nthat volume rises about 57% of the time.\n14\nBroadening Bottoms\nTable 1.1\nIdentification Characteristics of Broadening Bottoms\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nPrice trend\nThe short-term price trend should be downward leading to the\nformation.\nShape\nMegaphone shape with higher highs and lower lows.\nTrend lines\nPrices follow two trend lines: The top one slopes up and the bottom\none slopes down.\nTouches\nShould have at least two minor highs and two minor lows, but not\nnecessarily alternating touches.\nVolume\nThe overall trend is usually upward, sometimes with a U shape.\nBreakout\nA breakout occurs when price closes above the formation’s high\n(upward breakout) or below the pattern’s low (downward breakout).\nSee text for details.

    "text": "If you look closely at broadening bottoms, you will find that volume some-\ntimes follows price. In Figure 1.1, the price decline between peak 1 and trough\n2 shows a receding volume trend. When prices head up from point 2 to point 3,\nso does volume. If you were to place a thin wooden plank between the volume\npeaks in late November and late January, it would bow downward in a U shape.\nA U-shaped volume pattern occurs slightly more often than other shapes.\nBreakout. The breakout point is difficult to identify in a broadening for-\nmation as it develops. I look for the place where price pierces the up or down\ntrend line or makes an extended move. If price pierces the trend line, then the\npenetration point becomes the breakout point. If prices move up and follow\nalong the top trend line without piercing it, then I backtrack to the prior minor\nhigh and draw a horizontal line forward in time until prices cross it. When that\nhappens, that is the breakout point.\nLet me give you an example. Consider the broadening bottom shown in\nFigure 1.2. The price trend over the preceding month leading to the formation\nis downward. The two trend lines outline a widening price pattern as you\nwould expect from a broadening formation. There are more than two minor\nhighs and two minor lows pictured, meeting another criterion mentioned \nin Table 1.1.\nWhere is the breakout? This formation is particularly easy. If you extend\nthe top trend line upward, you find that prices rise well above the line, signal-\ning an upward breakout. Then it is just a matter of backtracking to the highest\nminor high and drawing a horizontal line to determine the actual breakout\nprice.

During this time, prices\nrose above the high of the formation (see point A).\nA breakout occurs when price closes beyond the formation high or low.\nPoint A is not an upward breakout because the close is at 33.88, well below the\nformation high of 34.25.

    "text": "terns with downward breakouts fail to drop more than 15%. For upward\nbreakouts, patterns cross the halfway mark between rises of 15% and 25%.\nThese results suggest that you should not depend on a large rise or large\ndecline after a BB. Scanning down each row, we also see that BBs in bull markets\nwith upward breakouts have the lowest failure rates. Those are the ones to buy.\nAnother way to use Table 1.3 is to assess how likely it is that your trade\nwill fail. If you have a cost of trading of 5% and you want to make 20%, how\nmany patterns in a bull market with upward breakouts will fail to rise at least\n25% (5 + 20)? Answer: 59%. Just 41% of the patterns will meet your profit\nmargins. Since the majority will fail, your winners must do quite well to com-\npensate for the losses.\nTable 1.4 shows statistics related to BB performance after the breakout.\nFormation end to breakout. There is a delay between price touching\nthe trend line the final time and closing above it. This delay averages between\n3 weeks and 5 weeks. It takes longer to break out in a bull market than a bear\nmarket because the decline in a bear market is often steeper.\nYearly position. Most of the breakouts occur near the yearly low. This\nmakes sense for downward breakouts, especially those in bear markets. The\nonly exception is in bull markets. They show 44% of the breakouts occurring\nin the middle of the yearly price range.\nYearly position, performance. In most entries, the sample counts are\nfew, making the results unreliable. Those BBs with breakouts following the\nmarket trend (bull market, up breakout and bear market, down breakout) do\nbest when the breakout is near the yearly high.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. The throwback/pullback rate hovers\naround 43% except for BBs in a bear market with a downward breakout. They\npullback 56% of the time. Still, the rates are too low to use in forming a reli-\nable trading strategy.\nThe average time for the stock to return to the breakout price is less than\n2 weeks. In most cases, when a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suf-\nfers. Look for overhead resistance to an upward move or underlying support to\na downward breakout before investing. If the congestion zone is nearby (less\nthan 5% away), prices will likely push through, but overhead resistance will\nretard momentum and performance will suffer.\nGaps. Gaps help performance in a bear market, but the result may change\nwith additional samples. In a bull market, breakout day gaps either hurt per-\nformance or have no influence.\nPartial rises and declines. The next four lines of Table 1.4 concern how\noften a partial rise or decline occurs and if they do occur, how the pattern per-\nforms. A partial decline correctly predicts an upward breakout 80% of the time\nin a bull market. The other variations are less successful, being right about\ntwo-thirds of the time. Figure 1.1 shows a good example of a partial decline\nand Figure 1.4 shows a partial rise. See the Glossary and Methodology chap-\nter for more information.\n20\nBroadening Bottoms",

For countertrend trades, performance\nsuffers after a partial rise or decline.\nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines appear as small loops hanging from the trend lines. They are par-\ntial rises or declines that failed to breakout: Prices made another crossing of the\nbroadening pattern. Intraformation partial rises or declines occur 13% or less\nof the time.\nTable 1.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Using numbers, it tells how soon your chart pattern will likely top or bot-\ntom out. For example, in a bear market with a downward breakout, over half\n(53%, or 25 + 28) bottom out within 2 weeks. At the other end of the table,\nalmost half the patterns (45%) in a bull market take longer than 2 months (over\n70 days) to reach the ultimate high.\nNotice the slight blip in the numbers around days 35 and 42. Bear mar-\nkets with upward breakouts and bull markets with downward breakouts show\nmore trend changes during that period. Thus, 5 to 6 weeks after the breakout,\nlook for a trend change.\nTable 1.6 shows size-related statistics. The results suffer from low sample\ncounts, so keep that in mind.\nHeight.

You can see in Figure 1.4 that the price never quite reaches the\ndownward price target.\nGo long at the low.

So she sold the stock short and received a fill at 13.88. It was a gamble,\nsure, but one she was comfortable making. In any case, she immediately placed\na stop at 14.25, or slightly above the high at point A.\nSusan was overjoyed to see the stock plummet 2 days later and race across\nto the other side of the formation, touching the bottom trend line at point B.\nUsually, her trades are not that easy. She decided to protect her profit and low-\nered the stop to the nearest minor high, shown as point C, at 13.75 or 0.15\nabove the high. Then she waited.\nThe stock bounced off the lower trend line instead of busting through as\nshe hoped. She decided to be patient and see what the stock did next. With her\nstop-loss order in place at the break-even price, she felt protected and com-\nfortable in letting the trade ride.\nThe stock bounced off the 12 support level and did a partial rise before\nmeeting resistance and heading back down. Two days after cresting, she made\nthe determination that on the next touch, the stock would pierce the lower\ntrend line and continue down. She doubled her stake by selling more stock\nshort at 12.75. She was wrong. The stock continued down 1 more day before\nmoving up again. Susan adjusted her stop-loss order to include the additional\nshares, but kept it at the same price level (13.75). Again she waited. The stock\nslowly climbed and reached a minor high of 13.13 before heading down again.\nThis time the decline was strong enough to punch through the support zone\nat the lower trend line.\nWhen the stock descended below point B, Susan lowered her stop-loss\norder to 0.15 above that point or 12.15. Then she looked at the measure rule\nfor the price target. She calculated a target of 9.88 and wondered if the stock\nwould really reach that price. To be safe, she decided to cash out if the stock\nreached 10.15, or 0.15 above the common support price of 10 (a whole num-\nber typically shows support).\nWhen the stock plunged to 10.38 on high volume, she wondered if she\nwas looking at a one-day reversal chart pattern. With those formations, it is\ndifficult to be sure if prices would reverse or not. She decided to hold on to her\noriginal target.\nTwo days later, prices zoomed upward and her stop closed out the trade\nat 12.15. She did not make much money (about 9% with a hold time of just\nover a month), but she gained experience and a few pennies to put in the bank.\n26\nBroadening Bottoms",

    "text": "about 2 weeks and established the base on which a horizontal trend line\nappears.\nThe reason for the horizontal trend line is one of perceived value. As the\nstock approached the $12 level, more investors and institutional holders pur-\nchased the stock. The desire to own the stock at what they believed a good\nvalue outweighed the reluctance of sellers to part with their shares. The\ndemand halted the decline in the stock and eventually sent prices skyward\nagain. This happened in mid-April as volume spiked along with the price. The\nenthusiasm caused the stock to reach a new high. Momentum was high enough\nso that the next day, prices rose even further before closing lower. With the\nsecond peak, a tentative trend line drawn along the tops of the formation\nsloped upward and gave character to the broadening formation.\nThe stock moved rapidly back down even as volume increased. This\ndecline stopped before it reached the lower trend line, signaling continued\nenthusiasm. Prices pushed higher and reached a new high, this one at 15.50 on\nMay 6. The up-sloping trend line resistance area repelled any further advance.\nThe stock simply did not have enough upward momentum to push through the\nselling pressure at the new level.\nThe next day volume dried up, but there was enough momentum remain-\ning for another try at the summit. When the attempt failed, the smart money\nheaded back for base camp and volume receded even further. As prices col-\nlapsed, other investors joined in the retreat and volume moved up. In less than\n2 weeks, prices were back at the lower trend line.\nAnother feeble attempt at a new high floundered on unremarkable vol-\nume. The stock moved horizontally and stalled out—a partial rise that often\nspells trouble for a stock. On June 4, prices dropped on high volume and\nreturned to the horizontal trend line. The stock paused there for just over a\nweek before moving down and punching through the support level at 12.25.\nA pullback in a bull market is quite common for ascending broadening\nformations, so it is no surprise that after a rapid 13% retreat, the stock turned\naround and pulled back to the base of the formation. Although not shown in\nFigure 2.2, the stock continued moving up until it began forming another\nascending broadening formation in late October with a base at 16.50.\nThe ascending broadening formation represents the desire of investors\nand traders to own the stock at a fixed price, in this case about 12.25. Their\nbuying enthusiasm pushes prices higher until mounting selling pressure causes\na halt to the rise and sends the stock tumbling. With each attempt, fewer peo-\nple are left willing to sell their shares until they receive an even higher price,\nso a broadening range of prices appears at the top. Eventually, the buying\nenthusiasm at the base of the formation collapses and removes the support for\nthe stock. When that happens, the stock punches through the support level and\ndeclines. It continues moving down until reaching a point where other\ninvestors perceive significant value and buy the stock.\nTour\n31",

While con-\nsidering the table, look at Figure 2.3, an ascending broadening formation on a\nweekly scale. \nShape. The overall shape of the formation looks like a megaphone with\none side horizontal.\nHorizontal bottom support line. The bottom of the formation follows\na horizontal trend line, while an up-sloping trend line bounds the top side. \nUp-sloping top trend line. The top trend line touches at least two\nminor highs. The horizontal trend line also shows two minor low touches as\nprices descend to the trend line. The various touch points help define the\nboundary of the formation.\nVolume. The volume trend is usually upward and U shaped, especially in\nthe last third of the pattern. In Figure 2.3, you can see the U shape from Feb-\nruary 1992 to the September 1992 peak, and then rounding down again before\nheading up to the peak in March 1993.\nPremature breakouts. I define premature breakouts to be prices that\nclose outside the formation boundary but return before the formation ends.\n32\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Ascending\nTable 2.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nLooks like a megaphone with the base of the\nformation horizontal and bounded on the top by\nan up-sloping trend line.\nHorizontal bottom support line\nA horizontal, or nearly so, trend line that connects\nthe minor lows.

    "text": "Premature breakouts for this formation are rare enough that they should not\nbe of concern.\nPrice action before breakout. In some ascending broadening forma-\ntions, prices make higher highs and form a solid, horizontal base at the start but\nthen move sideways for many months. Eventually, prices rise above the for-\nmation top or slide through the bottom trend line and stage a breakout. \nDownward breakout. Once a breakout occurs, a pullback sometimes\nhappens. Prices may continue moving up but they usually bounce off the lower\ntrend line and continue back down. A pullback gives investors another oppor-\ntunity to short the stock or add to their short position. Before shorting, how-\never, make sure the pullback is complete and prices are declining once again.\nSupport and resistance. I chose Figure 2.3 because it shows the two\ncommon areas of support and resistance. These areas follow the trend lines.\nAlong the base of the formation projected into the future, the support area\nrepels the decline over 2 years after the formation ends. The rising trend line\ntells a similar tale; it repels prices three times nearly a year later. The implica-\ntions of this observation can be profound. If you own a stock and it is breaking\nout to new highs, it would be nice to predict how high prices will rise. One way\nto do that is to search for formations such as this one. Many times, extending\nthe trend lines into the future will predict areas of support and resistance.\nAlthough the trend line did not predict the absolute high, it did suggest\nwhen prices would stall. The resistance area turned out to be a good opportu-\nnity to sell the stock.\nIdentification Guidelines\n33\nParker Drilling Co.

    "text": "Focus on Failures\nWhat can we learn from a review of the failures of this formation? Figure 2.4\nshows two broadening formations; the one on the left fails to descend but the\none on the right makes up for it. The figure makes one lesson clear: Always\nwait for a confirmed breakout before taking a position in a stock; that is, wait\nfor prices to fall below the lower trend line before selling your long position or\nselling short. Even though most ascending broadening formations break out\ndownward, the failure rate is too high to hazard an investment before knowing\nthe outcome. Had you sold the stock short during the first formation, your\nposition would not have made money for almost half a year. Look back at Fig-\nure 2.3. A short position in the stock at the lower trend line would have lost\nmoney for years.\nSelling a stock prematurely is just as bad. If you held a long position in\nthe stock shown in Figure 2.4 but sold it during June, you would have regret-\nted your trade until December when the footwear company slipped. Had you\nwaited for a downward breakout, you would have remained in the stock as it\nascended. Once the second broadening formation took shape, a sale after\nprices pierced the horizontal trend line would have gotten you out at a bet-\nter price.\n34\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Ascending\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan 95\nFeb\nMay 94\nJul\nJun\n– 16\n– 15\n– 14\n– 13\n– 12\n– 11\n– 10\n– 9\n– 8\n– 7\n– 6\n– 5\n– 4\nFailure\nto Descend\nBarry (R.G.)

For\nexample, 8% of the broadening patterns with downward breakouts in a bear\nmarket fail to drop more than 5%. This almost triples to 22% failing to drop\nmore than 10%. Over half (60%) fail to drop more than 25% after the breakout.\nComparing the columns, we see that the bull market, up breakout column\nshows the lowest failure rates. This makes sense because it is also the best per-\nformer (it has the highest average rise, as per Table 2.2).\nTable 2.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics. \nFormation end to breakout. It takes between 2 and 4 weeks for prices\nto close outside the trend-line boundary. This observation suggests that prices\noften bounce off the trend line, curl around, and then take their time making\ntheir way back to pierce the boundary.\nYearly position. Most of the breakouts occur near the yearly high for\nupward breakouts, and in the middle of the yearly price range for downward\nbreakouts. \nYearly position, performance. Mapping the performance over the\nyearly price ranges, we find that upward breakouts occurring near the yearly\nhigh in a bull market perform well. Downward breakouts do well when the\nbreakout is near the yearly low. \nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur about half\nthe time, and it takes the stock about 10 days to return to the breakout price.\nWhen they occur, performance suffers, as Table 2.4 shows.\nGaps. For patterns with upward breakouts, gaps hurt performance, but\nthe low sample count may be the reason. For downward breakouts, gaps either\nhelp performance or cause no pain. Notice the large gap size in a bear market\nafter a downward breakout.\nPartial rises and declines. A partial rise or decline is an accurate gauge\nof an impending breakout. Consult the Glossary on how to recognize them.\nUsing a partial rise or decline, you can get into the stock at a better price than\nif you wait for the breakout.\nDoes a partial rise or decline interfere with momentum? Yes. If you com-\npare the average rise or decline from Table 2.2 with the partial rise or decline\nperformance in Table 2.4, you will find that performance suffers after a partial\nrise or decline. However, using the feature to enter a trade earlier than the\nbreakout will tend to help performance.\nIntraformation partial rises and declines. How often does a partial rise\nor decline fail to predict an immediate breakout? Answer: between 4% and\n15% of the time, depending on the market conditions and breakout directions.\nTable 2.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. We have seen that the decline in a bear market is usually swift. Almost half\nof downward breakouts reach the ultimate low in less than 2 weeks. Upward\nbreakouts take more time to reach the ultimate high, sometimes much longer.\nIn a bull market, 48% are still searching for the top after 70 days.\n38\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Ascending",

Countertrend trades show either no differ-\nence or narrow patterns that perform slightly better. I used the median length\nas the divider between narrow and wide.\nAverage formation length. The average pattern length from the first\nminor high/low trend-line touch to the last averages between 2 and 2.5 months.\nHeight and width combinations. Tall and wide patterns outperform all\nother combinations. Avoid short and wide ones for the best performance.\nTable 2.7 shows volume-related statistics. \nVolume trend. Some analysts suggest that low volume before the break-\nout implies a powerful situation. In a bull market, that appears to be the case\nwith this chart pattern. Bear markets show the reverse, with patterns having a\nrising volume trend performing better than do those with a falling trend. \nVolume shapes. Most of the broadening patterns do well when a dome-\nshaped volume pattern appears. The one exception is a bull market with a\ndownward breakout; they perform better with U-shaped volume.\nBreakout volume. Heavy breakout volume helped the pattern perform\nin all cases except downward breakouts in a bear market. There, patterns with\nlight breakout volume showed better performance.\nStatistics\n39\nTable 2.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High or Low\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market, \nup breakout\n16%\n11%\n16%\n11%\n8%\n5%\n3%\n5%\n3%\n3%\n19%\nBull market, \nup breakout\n22%\n5%\n3%\n1%\n2%\n8%\n4%\n4%\n0%\n2%\n48%\nBear market, \ndown breakout\n31%\n14%\n11%\n6%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n0%\n0%\n5%\n28%\nBull market, \ndown breakout\n34%\n13%\n8%\n4%\n3%\n5%\n5%\n2%\n3%\n1%\n22%",

    "text": "Trading Tactics\nTable 2.8 lists trading tactics.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule predicts a target price. Compute the\nheight, the difference between the highest high and the horizontal trend line\nin the formation. For upward breakouts, add the height to the highest high in\nthe pattern. For downward breakouts, subtract this value from the value of the\nhorizontal trend line. The result is the target price. The target should serve as\nthe minimum price move to expect, but with ascending broadening formations,\nprices usually miss the target. Bull market accuracy ranges from 68% (up break-\nouts) to 32% (down breakouts). Bear markets targets are correct 43% (up\nbreakouts) and 51% (down breakouts) of the time.\nFor a more conservative approach, try calculating the formation height and\ndividing by 2, and then applying the difference to the pattern’s high or low price.\nFigure 2.5 makes the measure rule clear. The height of the formation is\nthe difference between the highest high (34.13) and the trend-line price\n(29.25), or 4.88. Subtract the result from the trend-line price, giving a target\nprice of 24.37. The nearer target in the figure uses half the formation height,\nor 2.44, to give a price target of 26.81. \nPartial rise or decline. A partial rise or decline can be difficult to trade\nbecause prices often pause partway across the chart pattern on their way to the\nopposite side. This pause looks like a partial rise or decline. Wait before buy-\ning to be sure that prices are unlikely to continue in the original direction. Try\nbuying when prices close beyond the halfway point between the minor\nlow/high and the trend line. \nFor example, if the top trend line is at 20 and prices have declined from\nthere to 14 then started back up in what you suspect is a partial decline, buy\nwhen the price closes above 17 (that is half the distance between 20 and 14). You\nmight use Fibonacci retracements of 38%, 50%, or 62% as buying locations. If\nprices turn at those retracement levels, then consider opening a position.\nTrading Tactics\n41\nTable 2.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nCompute the formation height from highest high to the\nhorizontal trend line. For upward breakouts, add the height\nto the highest high in the pattern. For downward breakouts,\nsubtract the height from the value of the horizontal trend\nline. The result is the target price. More accurate targets use\na formation height divided by 2.\nPartial rise or decline\nUse a partial rise or decline as an entry signal.\nWait for confirmation\nIf you own the stock and prices close below the lower trend\nline, sell.\nIntraformation trade\nFor tall patterns, buy near the lower trend line and sell near\nthe top as prices curl down.",

So when prices bounced\noff the low, he covered his short the following day, shown as point B, at 30.50.\nImmediately, he went long and bought the stock at the same price.\nPalmer placed a stop-loss order just below the horizontal trend line, at\n29.25, just in case. Then he extended the top trend line but worried that the\nstock might not reach it. He opted to put a target price below the old high at\npoint A. In less than a week, the stock reached his target and sold at 33.50\n(point C). Since the stock was still showing an upward bias, he laid back for a\nbit and waited for the trend to reverse. Three days later he sold the stock short\nagain at 33. This time, he put a sell order above the lower trend line at 29.50.\nThe trade went against him. It rose to 34 and oscillated up and down for nearly\n3 weeks, never quite reaching his stop-loss point of 34.38. Then the stock\nplunged and zipped across the formation. It hit his target price at point D, and\nhe covered his short.\nSensing a shift in the investment winds, he went long on the stock at the\nsame price but put a stop loss below the lower trend line. The following day\nprices hit his stop at 29.25 and he took a small loss. For some unexplained rea-\nson, Palmer walked away from the stock at this point.

Upward breakouts show the\npattern performing as a continuation of the uptrend twice as often as a rever-\nsal. Downward breakouts show the opposite: more act as reversals. Continua-\ntions perform better in bull markets, reversals in bear markets, regardless of the\nbreakout direction.\nThe bull market break-even failure rate is about three times the bear\nmarket rate. This finding suggests the pattern is happier in a bear market.\nThat analysis changes for higher failure rates. In other words, this pattern per-\nforms well in a bear market to begin with, but for longer trades, patterns in a\nbull market show smaller failure rates.\nAfter the breakout and after prices reach the ultimate low, the rebound is\nspectacular: 55%. Thus, if you can correctly identify when the trend changes,\nyou can make a ton of money—even if you are late getting into the trade.\nHowever, the right-angled and descending broadening (RADB) chart\npattern gives lackluster performance. The average rise or decline is well below\nthat of other chart pattern types, so trade this one carefully. \nTour\nWhat do descending broadening formations look like and why do they form?\nFigure 3.1 is an example of the chart pattern.

There, investors selling the stock matched\nbuyers eager to own the security and the rise stalled. It traveled sideways until\nMay 10 when it moved below the prior minor low. As the stock approached the\n31 level, it entered a support zone set up by the retracement in mid-March.\nThe decline stalled and moved sideways for several days. Due to the support\nlevel, many investors believed that the decline was at an end and the stock\nwould move higher. It did. As volume climbed, the price gapped upward and\nquickly soared back to the old high.\nThe stock ran into selling pressure from institutions and others trying to\nsell blocks of shares at a fixed price. The available supply halted the advance.\nPrices hung on for a few days, moved a bit lower, and paused before beginning\na rapid decline to a new minor low.\nAs volume climbed, the stock declined until it touched the lower trend\nline, a region of support. Suspecting an oversold stock, investors bought and\nforced it higher again. When the stock reached the old high, there were fewer\nshares available for purchase. Apparently, those investors and institutions who\nwere trying to get 35 a share for their stock sold most of their shares in the pre-\nceding months.

About half the pat-\nterns will fail to move more than 20%. \nLater I discuss the measure rule, but suppose it says that prices will climb\nfrom 10 to 13, a 30% move. How likely is that in a bull market? Table 3.3\nshows the answer. Since 63% fail to climb more than 30%, it seems unlikely\nthat prices will reach 13. Be conservative and set a lower target.\nTable 3.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\nFormation end to breakout. It takes between 3 and 6 weeks before\nprices close outside the pattern’s trend-line boundary. Thus, if you do not\nimmediately recognize the broadening pattern, you should still have plenty of\ntime to take appropriate action. \nYearly position. Where in the yearly price range do we find the break-\nout from the broadening pattern? For upward moves, the breakout occurs most\noften within a third of the yearly high. Downward moves show the reverse,\nwith many patterns breaking out near the yearly low.\nYearly position, performance. Which of the three price ranges per-\nforms best? The results map across market conditions. Broadening patterns in\nbull markets seems to perform best when the breakout is in the middle of the\nyearly price range. For bear markets, those with breakouts near the yearly low\nperform best. \nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur about half\nthe time, and it takes the stock less than 2 weeks to return to the breakout\nprice. When a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suffers. Look for\nnearby support or resistance zones that might interfere with price movement\nand cause a retrace.\nGaps. Most of the time, breakout day gaps hurt performance. The lone\nexception is in a bull market with a downward breakout from an RABD. In that\ncase gaps help, but the samples are few.\nPartial rises and declines. A partial rise or decline works best in a bear\nmarket. They correctly predict the breakout direction between 66% and 80%\nof the time. Bull markets do not fare as well, being correct between 54% and\n63% of the time. Still, a partial rise or decline allows you to enter a position in\na stock before the breakout and at a better price. \nIf you compare the average rise or decline from Table 3.2, you will find\nthat a partial rise or decline usually hurts performance. \nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines are rare, ranging between 17% for patterns with upward break-\nouts in bear markets, to 6% for patterns with downward breakouts. An\nintraformation partial rise or decline looks like a loop touching the trend line.\nThey occur once the pattern is established (at least two touches of each trend\nline), but a breakout in the anticipated direction does not follow. Instead, prices\ncross the pattern to the opposite trend line. Since the numbers are so low, they\nshould not be of concern.\n56\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Descending",

This finding suggests that the combination (bull/up) is the\nbest performing, and a look back at Table 3.2 confirms that expectation.\nWhat do all the numbers mean? If you have a broadening pattern with a\ndownward breakout and the general market (as measured by the S&P 500\nindex) is bullish, scan the table to help determine how long it will take to reach\nthe ultimate low.

Com-\npute the formation height by first taking the difference between the highest\nhigh (49.50) and the lowest low (43.50). Add the result (6) to the value of the\nhorizontal trend line to get a target price of 55.50. Prices reach this target dur-\ning mid-March 1996 as the stock climbs on its way to 60.\nIf the stock breaks out downward, the measure rule computation is nearly\nthe same. Subtract the formation height from the lowest low giving a target\nprice of 37.50. Be aware that upward breakouts in a bull market are more likely\nto reach their targets (63%) than other combinations. Refer to the Results\nSnapshot, “Percentage meeting price target” for the statistics.\nWait for confirmation. You might think that price will break out\nupward in a rising price trend, but it does not a suprising percentage of the\ntime.

    "text": "Stops. Once you know the target price, you can make a profit and loss\nassessment of the trade. What is the likely downward move compared with the\ntarget price? Does the potential profit justify the risk of the trade? For Figure\n3.6, there is support in the 46 to 47 area. Examining the peaks and valleys of\nthe prior price action determines support and resistance levels. In March 1995\n(not shown in the figure), there is an area of congestion bounded by a sym-\nmetrical triangle with an apex at about 46. Additional resistance appears in July\nand October, as shown. Together, the 46 to 47 area makes a good location for\na stop-loss order.\nLet us say the stop is 45.75, just below the bottom of the support area. If\nthe trade happens at 50.50, which is the close the day after the upward break-\nout, that gives a potential loss of less than 10%. With a target price of 55.50,\nor 10% upside, the win/loss ratio is an unexciting one to one. In such a situa-\ntion, you could either tighten your stop by moving it higher (and risk getting\ntaken out by normal price action) or look elsewhere for a more profitable trade.\nRemember there is no rule that says you have to place a trade.\nIntraformation trading. If the broadening pattern is tall enough, go\nlong after prices rebound off the lower trend line and short when they rebound\noff the upper trend line. \n60\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Descending\nTable 3.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nCompute the formation height by taking the difference\nbetween the horizontal top and the lowest low in the\nformation. For upward breakouts, add the result to the value\nof the horizontal trend line. For downward breakouts,\nsubtract the value from the lowest low. The result is the\nexpected target price.\nWait for confirmation\nIt is unclear which way prices will break out, so it is best to\nwait for prices to close outside the trend lines. Once they do,\nexpect prices to continue moving in the direction of the\nbreakout. Place your trades accordingly.\nStops\nOnce a breakout occurs, consider the opposite side of the\nformation as the stop-loss point. However, in many cases you\nwill want something closer to your purchase price, so look for\nnearer support or resistance zones. Once the stock moves\nsubstantially, advance the stop to the break-even point or\nhigher.\nIntraformation \nFor aggressive traders, consider placing a trade as prices \ntrading\nreverse course at the trend line. Go long at the bottom and\nshort at the top, but be sure to use stops to protect against\nan adverse breakout.\nPartial rise\nShort a stock if you see a partial rise once prices curl around\nand begin heading back down in a bear market.",

His order, placed at point C in Figure 3.6 (46.38), was just\nafter the stock bounced off the lower trend line.\nHe monitored it closely and watched the stock move up the very next day,\nthen ease lower.

Patterns in a bull market with upward\nbreakouts do better for price runs longer than 15%—Table 3.3.\n• In a bull market, select patterns with breakouts in the middle of the\nyearly price range. In a bear market, select those with breakouts near\nthe yearly low—Table 3.4.\n• Throwbacks and pullbacks hurt performance. Pick patterns with little\noverhead resistance or underlying support—Table 3.4.\n• Breakout day gaps hurt performance—Table 3.4.\n• A partial rise correctly predicts the downward breakout direction 80%\nof the time in a bear market—Table 3.4.\n• Watch for a trend change a month after an upward breakout in a bear\nmarket—Table 3.5.\n• Select tall patterns—Table 3.6.\n• Pick narrow patterns in a bear market—Table 3.6.\n• Choose patterns with a rising volume trend—Table 3.7.\n• Patterns with a U-shaped volume pattern do well after an upward\nbreakout.

    "text": "top formation. Astute traders jumped on the bandwagon at this point and pur-\nchased the stock. They wanted to play the anticipated rise as the formation\nbroadened out. The stock cooperated and moved higher, reaching the top\ntrend line once again at a new high of 55.50.\nThe steepness of the ascent in the latter stages was unsustainable. The\npeak looked like a one-day reversal, with a close near the low of the day and a\ntall daily price swing. However, volume was unconvincing. It was higher that\nday than during the prior week, but it certainly was not of the caliber of the late\nNovember spike. In any case, the stock tumbled and soon reached a new low of\n43.50, stopping right at the down-sloping trend line. Once the stock began\nmoving higher, the momentum players jumped on board and volume increased\nalong with the price. Buying enthusiasm and rising momentum pushed the\nstock higher, climbing through the top trend line. An upward breakout occurred.\nThroughout the various peaks and troughs of this formation, there was a\nstruggle between buyers and sellers. Near the lows, the buyers believed the\nstock was oversold and they eagerly bought it. At the top, they quickly sold\ntheir shares and pocketed handsome profits. This selling, of course, sent the\nstock back down.\nSome investors, seeing the stock decline below their purchase price and\nstill believing that the stock had value, bought more. That behavior also helped\nturn the stock around at the lows and probably explained their heightened\nnervousness at the tops. They wanted to keep their gains this time, instead of\nwatching them evaporate should the stock decline again. \nThe formation in Figure 4.1 also makes evident that identifying the ulti-\nmate breakout is exceedingly difficult. It appears that each new high or new\nlow may be the final breakout. Only when prices move in the opposite direc-\ntion is it clear that prices will not break out. We explore ways to profit from\nthis behavior in the Trading Tactics section.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 4.1 shows the identification guidelines for the broadening top formation. \nPrice trend. The first criterion is the price trend leading to the forma-\ntion. This price trend is what differentiates a broadening top from a broaden-\ning bottom. For a broadening top, the price trend should be leading up to the\nformation, not down as in its bottom counterparts. This is just an arbitrary des-\nignation I have chosen to distinguish the two formations.\nShape and trend lines. Trend lines drawn across the peaks and valleys\nresemble a megaphone.

Figure 4.1 shows three minor\nhighs touching the top trend line and four minor lows either nearing or touching\nthe bottom trend line. The minor highs and minor lows need not alternate as\nprices crisscross the formation.\nVolume. Linear regression on the volume trend shows it trending up.\nMany times, the volume pattern mimics the price pattern: rising and falling\nalong with price. However, my research shows that a U-shaped volume pattern\noccurs most often.\nBreakout. A breakout happens when prices move outside the trend-line\nboundaries or follow a trend line for an extended time. In Figure 4.1, if you extend\nthe top trend line upward, it will intersect prices at about 58. Prices push through\nthis level and move higher. When a breakout occurs, I consider the actual break-\nout price to be the value of the highest peak in the formation. In Figure 4.1, for\nexample, the breakout price is 55.50, or the high at the early December peak.\nFor an example of how to apply the various guidelines, consider the\nbroadening top shown in Figure 4.2. At first glance, it looks like a large mega-\nphone with price trends that generally follow two sloping trend lines. The top\ntrend line slopes upward and the bottom one slopes downward, each intersect-\ning the minor highs or lows at least twice.

They look\nlike loops touching a trend line, and they occur after the pattern is established. \nTable 4.5 shows a frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high or\nlow. For example, in a bull market with an upward breakout, almost half (48%)\ntake longer than 70 days to reach the ultimate high. About a quarter (27%, or\n22 + 5) top out in fewer than 2 weeks. This observation suggests that in a bull\nmarket, you should be patient. \nIn a bear market with a downward breakout, 30% reach bottom in the\nfirst week. Half (48%) bottom in 2 weeks. Just 11% are still searching for the\nultimate low after 70 days. Thus, be prepared to take profits quickly. \nScan across the rows for upward blips in the numbers. They usually occur\nabout a month after the breakout and signal a possible trend change. Bear mar-\nkets are especially prone to this behavior (4 to 6 weeks after the breakout,\naccording to Table 4.5).\nTable 4.6 shows statistics related to size. \nHeight. In most cases, tall patterns do better than do their short coun-\nterparts. The one exception is in a bear market with an upward breakout. \nTo use this information, measure the pattern’s height from the highest\nhigh to the lowest low. Divide the difference by the breakout price (for upward\nbreakouts, it is the highest high in the pattern; for downward breakout, use the\nlowest low). Then compare the result with the median shown in Table 4.6. A\nresult higher than the median means you have a tall pattern; lower means a\nshorter pattern. For best results, select tall broadening tops and avoid short ones.\nWidth. Sometimes wide patterns outperform (bull market, up breakout\nand bear market, down breakout), and sometimes narrow ones do better (bear\nmarket, up breakout).

The first thing to consider about trading tactics is the\nmeasure rule. The measure rule predicts the price to which the stock will\nmove. For many formations, one simply computes the height of the formation\nand adds the result to the breakout price. Broadening formations are not much\ndifferent. Consider Figure 4.5. The height of the formation is the difference\nbetween the highest high (12.13) and the lowest low (10), or 2.13. For upward\nbreakouts, add the height to the highest high in the chart pattern giving a min-\nimum price move of 14.26, as shown in the figure.\nHow do you make use of the measure rules? Imagine that you are con-\nsidering purchasing the stock. Since it is never clear which way a broadening\nformation will ultimately break out, it is difficult to pick a good long-term\nentry point. The easiest way to invest using the formation is to buy just after\nthe stock turns at the bottom trend line.\nGo long at the low.

    "text": "78\nBroadening Tops\nbuy order, compute the target price using the measure rule. The target price\nwill help you determine if the potential gain is worth the risk. In the example\nshown in Figure 4.5, the purchase price is about 10.38 and the target price is\n14.25, a 37% move. The stop loss should be 9.85, for a potential loss of 5%,\nwhich gives a reward-to-risk ratio of 7 to 1, more than enough to risk a trade.\nOn an upward breakout, prices reach the target about 60% of the time.\nThus, do not depend on prices reaching the target.\nLong stop. Buy the stock as soon after it touches the lower trend line and\nmoves higher. Place a stop-loss order 0.15 below the lowest low (0.15 below\npoint A). Should prices drop, your position will likely be sold before a large \nloss occurs.\nIf the stock fails to break out upward, perhaps you can join the ride to the\nupper trend line. Buy when prices turn upward at the lower trend line, then be\nready to sell once prices reach the old high. Prices may pause for a bit before\nmoving higher and tagging the top trend line or they may reverse at this point.\nMake sure your stops have been raised to protect your profits.\nWhat about the measure rule for downward breakouts? Again, the for-\nmation height is 2.13. Subtract 2.13 from the lowest low (10) to arrive at the\ntarget price of 7.87. If prices break out downward, they should reach 7.87.\nHowever, the reliability of the target price for downward breakouts is just 35%\n—not very reassuring.\nShort tips. For short positions in broadening tops, open the short after\nthe price touches point B and begins heading down. Place a stop 0.15 above the\nhighest high (12.28 in this case) to limit your losses. Lower your stop to the\nnext minor high or apex of the broadening top (either 11.88 or 11.13 in this\ncase) once the stock nears point A. Sometimes the stock will not make it down\nto the trend line before beginning to move up. At other times, there is a\nlengthy pause before prices turn around or continue down. A lower stop-loss\npoint helps you achieve at least some measure of profit.\nPartial decline. The last trading tactic is to look out for partial rises or\ndeclines, which occur when prices begin to cross the formation but do not\ncome close to the opposite side. Instead, prices reverse course and break out\nsoon after. When you see a partial rise or decline, place a trade once the stock\nreverses course. If a breakout happens, then consider adding to your position.\nSample Trade\nSandra has always taken a liking to the stock market but never had enough\nmoney to jump into the game. Still, she paper traded stocks just to get a feel for\nthe markets and dreamed of one day trading for real.

After paying taxes to the government, she sud-\ndenly realized there was no need to continue working. “Why wait till I’m older\nwhen my health might be gone or I might die young like my parents?” She\nretired at 29.\nSandra knew that if she cut her expenses to the bone she could live off the\nsavings. She paid off the mortgage, the car loan, and the credit card balances,\nand she stopped going out to eat in restaurants. Her lifestyle changed to\naccommodate the limited income, but one thing she would not compromise:\nher paper trading.\nAfter opening a brokerage account, she waited for the perfect trade and\nfinally found it; the one shown in Figure 4.5. She saw the broadening top for-\nmation early enough to buy into the stock before the breakout. Two days after\nthe stock reached point A, she placed her order and received a fill at 10.50.\nImmediately, she placed a stop 0.15 below the lowest low, or 9.85 for a poten-\ntial loss of 6%.\nSandra applied the measure rule and was looking at a target of 14.25. If\neverything worked as expected, that would give her a return of over 35%. After\nshe placed the trade, she sat back and waited but kept an eye on the price\naction. When prices paused at the high of the formation, she wondered if the\ntrend was going to reverse. She considered taking her profits and running but\ndecided against it. After a few days, she recognized a flag formation and hoped\nthat it represented a half-staff move (the flag being a halfway point in the\nupward move). If that were true, she could expect a climb to 13.25 (that is the\ndistance from the top of the flag (12.13) to the start of the move at 10 projected\nupward using the lowest low in the flag at 11.13).\nA few days later, the stock not only fulfilled the measure rule for the flag\nformation, but for the broadening top as well. Did Sandra sell? No. Since the\nstock was moving up, she decided to let her profits ride. However, she did raise\nher stop to 11.85, or 0.15 below the formation high. She viewed this point as a\nsupport zone and hoped that should the stock retreat to that level, it would\nrebound before taking her out.\nIn mid-February, just after the second peak around 17 appeared, she rec-\nognized a double top formation. She moved her stop to 0.15 below the confir-\nmation point, or 14.25. About 2 weeks after raising her stop, her position sold\nwhen the stock plunged from the prior close at 15.63 to 12.13. After commis-\nsions, she made 33% in less than 4 months.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select broadening\ntops that perform better after the breakout.

Since the pattern is so rare in a bear market, many of the remarks in\nthis chapter concern bull markets only. The break-even failure rate is probably\nhigher than the 2% shown in a bull market due to the low sample count. For\ndownward breakouts, the break-even failure rate is probably accurate at 11%.\nThe 38% average rise is above the 36% rise for other bullish chart patterns. \nIf you can tell when the trend changes, you can make a lot of money after\na downward breakout. For example, after the stock reaches the ultimate low,\nprices rise an average of 49%. Thus, even if you miss the turn, there are still\nprofits waiting if you trade the pattern properly.\nABWs have a few surprises, most of which we have seen before. A partial\nrise comes at the end of the pattern, and it accurately predicts a downward\nbreakout about 75% of the time. More about that and the other surprises in the\nStatistics section.\nTour\nWhat does an ascending broadening wedge look like? Consider the chart pat-\ntern in Figure 5.1. The first thing you notice is the two sloping trend lines; the\ntop one has a slightly steeper slope than the bottom one. Together, the two\ntrend lines spread out over time but both slope upward. Once prices pierce the\nbottom trend line, they drop rapidly. The chart looks like a pie-shaped wedge\nthat slopes uphill. That is why it is called an ascending broadening wedge. The\nprice action alternates and is contained by two nonparallel trend lines. \nFigure 5.2 shows a better example of a broadening wedge, with two up-\nsloping trend lines where the slope of the top trend line is much steeper than\nthe bottom one.\n82\nBroadening Wedges, Ascending",

    "text": "Figures 5.1 and 5.2 both show a similar situation. The formation appears\nat the end of a rising price trend and signals a reversal. Although a reversal is\nnot always the case, nor is the formation required to be at the end of a rising\nprice trend, both situations occur more often than not.\nFigure 5.2 also shows an interesting pattern that is key in identifying the\nstart of a new price trend: the partial rise. After touching the lower trend line,\nprices again move up but fail to touch the higher trend line. As prices descend,\nthey pierce the lower trend line and continue moving down. The chart also\nshows a similar situation that occurs earlier in the price pattern, around the\nstart of the new year: That rising price trend fails to touch the upper trend line.\nPrices return to the lower trend line, then rebound and zoom up again to\ntouch the higher trend line. The partial rise fails to predict a change in trend.\nWe explore partial rises later.\nWhy does a broadening wedge form? Pretend for a moment that you are\nthe head of an investment conglomerate that has big bucks to spend and wants\nto buy shares in another company. When the price is low, you instruct your\ntrading department to begin buying. The sudden buying demand forces the\nprice to climb even though the trading department spreads its orders over sev-\neral days and through several brokers. The trading department tries to keep its\nbuying quiet, but the word gets out that you are in the market. The momen-\ntum players jump on your coattails and ride the stock upward by buying too.\nThis sends the stock higher than you expected, so your trading department\nstops buying for the moment.\nValue investors, sensing an overbought situation developing, are willing\nto sell their shares at the higher price. Soon the stock is moving down again.\nBut before it can reach its old low, the buy-the-dip crowd jumps in and halts\nthe decline. Your trading department, seeing a higher low form, jumps back in\nand buys while the price is still reasonable. Some new value investors also\ndecide the stock is worthy of a flyer and add to the buying pressure. The com-\npany itself gets into the act and buys shares authorized by the board of direc-\ntors as a share-buyback program announced long ago. The buyback program\nis nearing the expiration date and the company feels it is the right time to buy\nto complete their promise to shareholders.\nThe stock makes a new high. When it climbs high enough, the selling\npressure overwhelms the buying demand and sends the shares lower, but the\nprice will not drop far—not with everyone trying to buy at a good price. What\nyou have then are much higher highs from the unbridled buying enthusiasm\nand higher, but more sane, lows as your conglomerate and the company itself\ntry to buy near a fixed low price. You never quite succeed and pay higher and\nhigher prices as the minor lows move up.\nSoon, however, the stock is too pricey even for your tastes. You may even\ndecide it is time to sell some, or all, of your holdings. Meanwhile, the momen-\ntum players send the stock coasting higher, but this time the price does not\ncome close to the upper trend line.\n84\nBroadening Wedges, Ascending",

When they finish placing their trades, the meager buying demand\nabates and the stock crashes through the lower trend line and heads down further.\nIdentification Guidelines\nThere are a number of identification guidelines, outlined in Table 5.1, that\nmake this formation unique. As I discuss the different guidelines, consider the\nascending broadening wedge depicted in Figure 5.3. This formation is differ-\nent from Figures 5.1 and 5.2 in that it is born from a region of consolidation.\nFrom the beginning of the study in July 1991, prices move generally horizon-\ntally and do not fall much below the 15.38 level (Figure 5.3 shows only a por-\ntion of the prior price action).\nThe situation changes just before the new year. Prices start moving up on\nDecember 23. They reach a new high in mid-January but soon move down. At\nthat point, two tentative trend lines connect the highs and lows. Although it is\ntoo early to form a definitive conclusion, a broadening wedge appears to be\ntaking shape. After prices move up and touch the upper trend line then pull\nIdentification Guidelines\n85\nTable 5.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nLooks like a megaphone, tilted up, with price action that\noutlines two up-sloping trend lines.\nTrend lines\nThe top trend line has a steeper upward slope than the lower\none and neither is horizontal.\nTouches\nThere should be at least three distinct touches (or near\ntouches) of the trend lines on each side.

Prices travel higher for 3 days in a tight, narrow pattern\nthen zoom upward and touch the upper trend line.

The volume pattern is irregular but generally rises as prices move\nup and recedes as prices decline. Although it is not clear from the charts, volume\ntends to rise over time. However, this tendency is slight when considering all\nascending broadening wedges and is not a mandatory selection guideline.\nBreakouts. Figure 5.3 shows an exceptional premature breakout. Usu-\nally, prices follow the lower trend line and do not penetrate it until very near\nthe breakout. When prices do break out, the price action can be messy, as\nshown in the figure. Sometimes price runs straight through the lower trend\nline without pausing, and sometimes it weaves around the trend line before\nfinally continuing down. In either case, the breakout is usually downward.\nPartial rise. The partial rise, already mentioned, occurs in half of the\nascending broadening wedges. Since it usually occurs just before a breakout, it\nis an important trend change indicator. In a partial rise, prices start moving up,\nafter having touched the lower trend line, then stop before touching (or com-\ning close to) the upper one.

In a bull market with an\nupward breakout, 10% failed to rise at least 10%.\nTable 5.3\nFailure Rates\nMaximum \nBull \nBear\nBull\nBear\nPrice Rise\nMarket, \nMarket, \nMarket, \nMarket,\nor Decline \nUp \nUp \nDown \nDown \n(%)\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\n5 (breakeven)\n1 or 2%\n0 or 0%\n19 or 11%\n3 or 14%\n10\n6 or 10%\n2 or 20%\n56 or 34%\n4 or 19%\n15\n13 or 22%\n5 or 50%\n84 or 51%\n7 or 33%\n20\n18 or 31%\n5 or 50%\n103 or 62%\n10 or 48%\n25\n25 or 43%\n6 or 60%\n127 or 77%\n13 or 62%\n30\n31 or 53%\n7 or 70%\n142 or 86%\n18 or 86%\n35\n35 or 60%\n8 or 80%\n145 or 87%\n18 or 86%\n50\n43 or 74%\n10 or 100%\n165 or 99%\n21 or 100%\n75\n51 or 88%\n10 or 100%\n166 or 100%\n21 or 100%\nOver 75\n58 or 100%\n10 or 100%\n166 or 100%\n21 or 100%",

    "text": "You can see how the failure rates start comparatively small then shoot up\nas the maximum price rise or decline increases. Ignoring the small sample\ncounts for bear markets, the lowest failure rates occur in patterns with an\nupward breakout in a bull market. Half the patterns fail to rise more than\nabout 27% under those conditions (bull/up). \nTable 5.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\nFormation end to breakout. It takes between 12 and 30 days before\nprice closes outside the trend-line boundary. That is an average, so your results\nwill vary. Upward breakouts take longer than downward ones to pierce the\ntrend line. This observation makes sense because the upper trend line has a\nsteeper slope and prices are rising along with the trend line. For downward\nbreakouts, the trend line slopes up but prices are falling.\nYearly position. Where in the yearly price range do ABWs occur? The\nbreakout usually happens near the yearly high except in a bear market with a\ndownward breakout, which shows more breakouts in the middle of the yearly\nrange.\nYearly position, performance. Mapping performance onto the yearly\nprice range, we find that the middle of the yearly price range performs better\nthan the other ranges. The exception is for ABWs with downward breakouts in\na bull market, but the sample size is small.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur about half\nthe time, and it takes the stock between 9 and 13 days to return to the break-\nout price. However, when throwbacks and pullbacks occur, performance suf-\nfers, as Table 5.4 shows (except for ABWs in a bear market with upward\nbreakouts). \nGaps. Most of the time, when a breakout day gap occurs, performance\nimproves. The exception: the 51% rise in a bull market may come down with\nadditional samples.\nPartial rises and declines. Consider the bull market, down breakout\ncolumn that has a good sample size. A partial rise correctly anticipated the\ndownward breakout 74% of the time. When a partial rise occurs, prices drop\n17% after the breakout, on average, meeting the average decline for ABWs. \nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines—those that occur within the pattern but with prices that continue\ncrossing the pattern—occur, at most, 17% of the time. Thus, you should feel\nsafe trading a partial rise or decline. They get you into the trade before the\nbreakout and correctly predict the breakout direction (usually). Consult the\nGlossary if you are unfamiliar with a partial rise or decline.\nTable 5.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Since the bear market samples are few, look at the two bull market rows.\nOver half (52%) of upward breakouts do not reach the ultimate high before 70\ndays. Half of all downward breakouts will bottom in the first month (20 + 10 +\n14 + 7 = 51% in 28 days). If price reaches the ultimate high or low quickly, the\nreturn is usually below those patterns that take longer. Thus, the key to this\n90\nBroadening Wedges, Ascending",

The measure rule for this formation is different from\nmost other formations in that it is based on the lowest low in the pattern, not\non the height of the formation (for downward breakouts only). Upward break-\nouts use the height from highest high to lowest low added to the highest high.\nThe result is the target price. The Results Snapshot lists the “Percentage meet-\ning price target” results.\nFigure 5.5 shows two ascending broadening wedges and application of the\nmeasure rule. Both formations are well formed, but the first one has a tendency\nto rise slightly above the top trend line before beginning its downhill run. The\nchart marks the lowest low in each formation. The low serves as the expected\nminimum price move. The formation on the left shows prices reaching the tar-\nget in mid-November just as prices turn around and rebound. The formation\nshown on the right has prices hitting the target when they plummet.\nThe reason for choosing the lowest low in the formation is simply for\nperformance. Using the formation low as the target price allows 58% to 86%\nof the formations to achieve the target. I like to see performance numbers\nabove 80%, so the 58% value is poor.

If you\nwait for a breakout before investing, you substantially increase your chances of\na profitable trade. Once prices decline below the lower trend line, sell the stock\nshort. Be prepared to cover the short as prices near the target, especially if the\nprice approaches an area of support.\nIn Figure 5.5, the lowest formation low on the left is also a support point.\nPrices decline to the low in early August then head up and create the formation.\nSeveral months later, prices decline to that level and turn around. As prices\ndecline after the second formation, the support level at 36 changes into resis-\ntance. During March, prices try to rebound but turn away near the 36 level.\nPartial rise. An exception to the wait for breakout-confirmation rule is if\na partial rise occurs. Looking again at Figure 5.5, you might conclude that\nthere is a partial rise in the right formation. Wrong. I define a partial rise as\nwhen prices touch the lower trend line, move up, then return to the lower\ntrend line. The figure shows prices starting from the top trend line, not the\nlower one. Figure 5.2 shows a properly identified partial rise.\nIf you detect a partial rise, consider shorting the stock. In 74% to 78% of\nthe cases, a downward breakout follows a partial rise. Since you are buying\nbefore the breakout, your profits should be larger. When the stock declines to\nthe lower trend line, move your stop-loss order to break even.

    "text": "Sample Trade\nCurtis works the night shift at a large bakery near his home. Working at night\nfrees the daylight hours for other activities, such as sleep. Occasionally, he\nspots a situation such as that shown in Figure 5.5, one that makes the morning\nsun seem even brighter.\nEach day before he hit the sack, he plotted the stock and watched with\namusement as the first broadening wedge formed. When the second one\nappeared, he wiped the sleep from his eyes and took notice. It was not so much\nthe broadening wedge that excited him; it was the wedge coupled with the dou-\nble top. Together, they spelled an especially bearish situation, one that he was\nwilling to shell out his hard earned money to trade.\nThe day after the stock closed below the lower trend line, Curtis sold the\nstock short and received a fill at 39.50. He used the double top measure rule to\nestimate his target price. With a top at 45.75 and a valley low of 36.25, the target\nturned out to be 26.75 (that is 45.75–36.25 subtracted from 36.25). He decided to\nplace an order to cover the short at 27.13, just above the whole number and just\nabove where everyone else was likely to place theirs. Then he went to bed.\nEach day, before he closed the curtains to get some sleep, he would check\non his stock. To him, it was pleasing to see the stock begin moving down\nimmediately and sailing below the nearest broadening wedge target price\n(38.88). He lost some sleep worrying about the upward retrace in March, and\nwondered if the party were over.\nCurtis hung in there and the stock eventually pierced the resistance zone\nand kept moving down. He hoped that the March resistance was just the cor-\nrective phase of a measured move down, which would place the target price at\n22.50, well below his target at 27.13. He decided not to be greedy and lower \nhis target. \nOn April 18 he was rudely awakened from his REM state by a phone call\nfrom his broker. The short was covered at his target price. He made about $12\na share. That put a smile on his face, and he went back to his dream of telling\nhis boss what he could do with the night shift.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to select patterns that perform\nwell.

With 117 samples, the descending broadening wedge (DBW) acted as\na consolidation, but no longer. The failure rate used to be 37%, but that included\npatterns breaking out in the wrong direction. The average rise was 46%, but\nwith three times the number of samples and a different way of measuring, the\naverage rise is now lower. Even the measure rule changed (that is, the percent-\nage meeting the predicted price target). I used the formation height and added it\nto the breakout price to get the target. Now the formation top suffices.\nI took my dog outside and played ball with her until I decided what to do.\nAlthough I had 300 samples, I needed more. So, I scoured the three databases\nI used for this book and found 464 patterns.

The stock begins rising in June 1994 and rounds over\nat the top a year later, in August. In September, the stock starts down in tight\noscillations that broaden over time. A month later, two trend lines drawn\nacross the highs and lows make the wedge shape clear.\nTour\n99",

Computing the slope of the\nvolume line using linear regression confirms the result; the slope is positive,\nwhich indicates volume is increasing.\nIn mid-October, prices gap up and shoot above the upper trend line. A\nbreakout occurs. Volume spikes upward and continues to be heavy for several\ndays as prices climb.\nAs you look at the chart, you may make an interesting observation. The\nprice trend has three stages: The first stage is the long bull-run from June 1994\nto August 1995, leading to a consolidation or retrace for 2 months (second\nstage), then prices move higher (third stage). In Figure 6.1, the broadening for-\nmation is a consolidation of the upward trend. Taken as a whole, it looks like\nthe corrective phase of a measured move up chart pattern.\nContrast Figure 6.1 with Figure 6.2, where a descending broadening\nwedge acts as a reversal of the intermediate-term price trend. Prices peak in\nMay 1992 and head lower. During August, prices begin to broaden out as they\ncontinue their downward spiral. By mid-September, a descending broadening\nwedge forms.\nVolume is low at the start of the formation but does have a few spikes. Into\nSeptember, volume moves up and becomes even more irregular. At  the start of\nOctober, as prices begin moving up, volume recedes. Prices pierce the top trend\nline on negligible volume and head higher.

There are a number of touches of the minor highs against the\ntop trend line and the minor lows against the bottom one. There should be at\nleast two distinct touches—two minor highs (top trend line) and two minor\nlows (bottom trend line)—to correctly define a broadening formation.\nVolume. The slope of the volume trend is usually upward, unlike forma-\ntions from the narrowing wedge family. The increasing volume pattern seems\nto catapult prices higher, sending them out the top of the formation. Volume\nat the breakout is usually high but need not be. As long as demand exceeds sup-\nply, prices will rise.\nBreakout. Just over half the time, the formation acts as a reversal of the\ntrend. Figure 6.2 shows an example. There is no easy way to differentiate a\nbudding consolidation from a reversal. Only the breakout direction decides\nwhich is which.\nPartial decline. The partial decline, such as that shown in Figure 6.3,\noften indicates an impending upward breakout. This works quite well for con-\nsolidations or reversals. \nWhy do these formations form?

At those points, prices are some-\nwhat more likely to stage a rebound. That is what occurs in Figure 6.3. Prices rise\nfrom a low of 13.63 to a high of 18.88. A 38% retrace of this range takes prices\nback to 16.88. This is quite close to 17, and you can see some hesitation in the\nstock at that level. However, once the stock approaches the 62% retrace level\n(15.63), the smart money knows the jig is up. They start buying heavily for the 5\ndays surrounding the new year.

Look at the bull market, upward breakout col-\numn. Six percent of the patterns fail to rise more than 5%. A quarter (26%) fail to\nrise at least 15%. Half fail to make a 30% rise. Bull markets with downward\nbreakouts are the worst performers: Half of those fail to rise more than 15%. \nBy matching the breakout direction and the general market condition\n(bull/bear) to your DBW, you can get a sense of how your pattern will perform.\nRemember that each failure occurs when prices reverse direction and move\nStatistics\n105",

    "text": "Partial rises and declines. Figure 6.3 shows an example of a partial\ndecline. Prices touch the top trend line then head toward the lower trend line,\ncurl around, and stage an upward breakout. In a bull market, a partial decline\nprecedes an upward breakout 87% of the time. Partial rises do not fare as well\nbecause of the low sample counts.\nWhen a partial rise or decline happens, does performance suffer? Yes and\nno. For upward breakouts, patterns having a partial decline show improved\nperformance. For downward breakouts, a partial rise hurts the postbreakout\ndecline, but that may change with more samples.\nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines look like normal partial rises and declines, but prices continue\ncrossing the pattern instead of breaking out. They look like small loops\nattached to the trend line. The good news is that they do not happen often.\nThus, you can trade on a partial rise or decline and get a better price (than the\nbreakout), without worrying about whether a breakout will follow immediately\n(without prices crossing the formation again). It usually does, at least 80% \nof the time. \nTable 6.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Notice how often prices reverse trend in the first few weeks. DBWs in a\nbull market with downward breakouts show 58% bottoming in the first 3\nweeks. DBWs in a bull market with upward breakouts show the fewest trend\nreversals: 27% in 3 weeks. They also show the most after 70 days: 49% are still\nlooking for the ultimate high.\nNotice the slight rise in bear market patterns changing trend 35 to 42\ndays after the breakout. I have seen this rise in other bearish chart patterns, too\n(and some bullish ones like downward breakouts at day 49). Be prepared to take\nprofits 5 to 6 weeks after the breakout.\nTable 6.6 shows statistics related to DBW size. \n108\nBroadening Wedges, Descending\nTable 6.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High or Low\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market, \nup breakout\n29%\n11%\n7%\n2%\n6%\n8%\n3%\n0%\n3%\n3%\n27%\nBull market, \nup breakout\n15%\n6%\n6%\n7%\n3%\n3%\n3%\n3%\n4%\n2%\n49%\nBear market, \ndown \nbreakout\n36%\n14%\n12%\n8%\n4%\n8%\n4%\n2%\n4%\n2%\n6%\nBull market, \ndown \nbreakout\n30%\n17%\n11%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n6%\n0%\n0%\n4%\n19%",

If you are considering buying the stock shown in\nFigure 6.5, it is not obvious at first that a broadening wedge is forming. Over\ntime, once enough minor highs and lows appear, draw the two trend lines.\nThen, it becomes a matter of waiting for a breakout. Since most descending\nbroadening wedges break out upward, that is the way to trade it. Wait for\nprices to close above the top trend line before buying.\nPartial decline. An exception to the rule about waiting for confirmation\nis the partial decline. As prices move down from the top trend line, watch them\nclosely. If prices reach a support zone and begin moving up, buy because that\nis a partial decline, and it usually signals an impending upward breakout. Place\na stop 0.15 below the curl low, just in case.\nTrade the trend lines; stops. If the formation is especially wide, try an\nintraformation trade. Buy at the lower trend line and sell at the top one, or sell\nshort at the top and cover near the bottom. With the trend lines sloping down-\nward, a short sale will be more profitable. Use a stop 0.15 beyond the appro-\npriate trend line in case of an adverse breakout. Adjust your stop as prices\nmove in your favor. Place them 0.15 below a support zone (long trades) or\nabove a resistance area (short trades).\nTrading Tactics\n111\nTable 6.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nFor upward breakouts, use the highest high. For down-\nward breakouts, use the pattern height subtracted from\nthe lowest low in the pattern. However, that strategy\nworks only 32% to 36% of the time.\nWait for confirmation\nWait for prices to close beyond the trend lines before\nplacing a trade.\nPartial decline\nIf a stock shows a partial decline from the top trend line\nand begins to head back up, consider going long. An\nupside breakout most often follows a partial decline.\nTrade the trend lines\nIf the formation is especially broad, buy at the lower\ntrend line and sell at the top. If the stock executes a\npartial rise and begins falling, close out the position as\nit may break out downward. Alternatively, sell short at\nthe top trend line once prices are heading down and\nclose the position after it rebounds off the lower trend\nline.\nStops\nFor intraformation trading, place a stop on the other\nside of the trend line, just to catch an adverse breakout.\nMove the stop as prices cross the formation.

Even better, the stock moves lower for several\ndays, reinforcing her sell decision.\nIt turns out that she sold too soon, but she does not care. She spots\nanother promising formation in a stock she has been following for quite some\ntime. She leans back in her chair, smiles and mumbles something about luck,\nthen runs to the VCR and plugs in another Dirty Harry movie.\nThis trade shows the problem with placing a sell order at the price target.\nYes, Mary sold at a good price, but if she had used the stop-loss order to take\nher out, she probably would have made more. To let your profits run, raise the\nstop price, placing it slightly below the prior minor low, and raise it to the next\nhigher minor low when prices climb to a new high. Eventually, prices will\ndecline and your position will be sold. However, this gives the stock every\nopportunity to continue making new highs.\nFor sophisticated traders, compute the average daily trading range of the\nstock over the prior month and set a stop no closer than 1.5 times the average.\nFor example, if the stock has a daily trading range of $2, set the stop no closer\nthan $3 below the current daily low. If a minor low is $2.25 below the current\nlow, it is too close to use as a stop-loss point. Select one farther away. This\ntechnique allows the stock room to fluctuate without you being stopped out. \nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations on selecting patterns for bet-\nter performance. Refer to the associated table for more information.\n• Use the identification guidelines to select your pattern—Table 6.1.\n• Trade with the trend: Select patterns with upward breakouts in a bull\nmarket, downward breakout in a bear market—Table 6.2.\n• Patterns in a bull market with an upward breakout have the lowest fail-\nure rates for extended moves—Table 6.3.\n• Bull markets throw back/pull back less often than do bear markets—\nTable 6.4.\n• Throwback or pullbacks hurt performance—Table 6.4.\n• Breakout day gaps help performance—Table 6.4.\n• A partial decline in a bull market correctly predicts an upward break-\nout 87% of the time and performance improves, too—Table 6.4.\n• In a bear market, look for a trend change 5 or 6 weeks after the break-\nout, 7 weeks in a bull market—Table 6.5.\nFor Best Performance\n113",

    "text": "More than a year after I discovered the bump-and-run reversal (BARR) top, I\ndecided to look for its complement: the BARR bottom. The reasoning is sim-\nple. Many formations, such as double tops, ascending triangles, and triple tops\nall have bottom versions. Why not the bump-and-run reversal? It never\ndawned on me to look for the formation before then. As I searched through the\ndata looking for candidates, I was skeptical that the formation added real value.\nSome looked like cup-with-handle formations with the handle coming first,\nwhereas others looked like rounding bottoms. Only after I compiled the sta-\ntistics did my thoughts change.\nThe pattern is a strong performer with postbreakout gains between 31%\nand 38%. The break-even failure rate is small, coming in at 2% or less. The\npattern also has a few surprises but ones we have seen before: A throwback\nhurts postbreakout performance, and patterns both tall and wide perform bet-\nter than short and narrow ones. \nTour\nWhat is a bump-and-run reversal, anyway? If I had to name this formation\nindependent of all others, I would probably call it the frying pan or spoon for-\nmation because that is what it looks like. However, the formation is just a\nBARR top flipped upside down, so I call it a BARR bottom. I guess a more\naccurate description is an inverted BARR. \nWhy do BARR bottoms occur? Like the top version, the BARR bottom\nis a study of momentum. Consider the chart shown in Figure 7.1 on a weekly\nscale. Since late 1991, the stock was moving sideways—a trading range between\n6.50 and 11. However, that changed during the last week of October 1993,\nwhen the stock moved up and closed higher than the prior week. At first, this\ndid not seem unusual since many weeks close higher than the prior week, but\nthis one was different. It initiated a long climb to the highs of early January. On\nthe highest volume that the stock had seen in years, the stock hit a new high of\n14.38 during the week of January 14, 1994. Volume began tapering off, although\nit was still high, and prices tagged a much smaller peak during the week of\nMarch 25, at 14. The two minor highs, one in mid-January and another in late\nMarch, formed the basis of a down-sloping trend line.\nAs weekly volume trended lower, so did enthusiasm for the stock. Eventu-\nally, bullish sentiment could not sustain the high price and the stock collapsed.\nAs it headed down, volume continued to taper off. The upward momentum\nexperienced during the rise to the highs in January was now working against the\nstock. Over the course of a year, the stock gave back all its gains and, by mid-\nFebruary 1995, it started sinking to new lows.\nHigh volume a month later was key as it signaled a turning point. A week\nlater, again on high volume, the stock closed higher by over 10%. The upward\nmove had begun but soon stalled out. The stock moved sideways for another 2\n116\nBump-and-Run Reversal Bottoms",

When the stock reached\nthe trend line in mid-August, it was clear that it had executed a massive round-\ning bottom—a turn in the trend that signaled higher prices.\nThe stock pushed through the trend line on relatively high volume, then\npaused for a month, and formed a falling wedge or pennant. Following that, on\nvery high volume, prices jumped up to new highs, but this did not last very\nlong as the stock entered a consolidation phase just below 18.

After a deepening decline\nthat takes prices into the pan base, prices level out and\neventually soar out the right side.\nDown-sloping \nThe handle forms a down-sloping trend line that approximates\ntop trend line,\n0–45 degrees (but this varies with scaling). The handle portion \nlead-in height\nof the formation is called the lead-in as it leads in to the bump\nphase. The lead-in height measures from the trend line drawn\nacross the highs to the low (not necessarily the lowest low) of\nthe formation. Select the widest distance from the trend line to\nthe low, measured vertically, in the first quarter of the\nformation. The duration of the lead-in should be at least a\nmonth, but varies depending on the situation.\nBump phase\nThe bump is analogous to the frying pan base. The down-\nsloping trend line deepens to 60 degrees or more. Prices drop\nrapidly then level out and turn around, usually forming a\nrounded turn. After the turn, prices move up and sometimes\npause at the 30-degree trend line before moving higher. The\nbump height, as measured from the trend line to the lowest\nlow, should be at least twice the lead-in height. Strict\nadherence to this rule is not required, but it serves as a good\ngeneral guideline.\nUphill run\nOnce prices lift out of the bump phase, they begin an uphill\nrun that carries prices higher.\nVolume\nVolume is typically high during the three critical parts of the\nformation: formation start, bump start, and upward breakout.\nHowever, high volume is not a prerequisite.",

Although the rise\nis not a straight-line path, prices reach a new high a year later (the highest peak\non the left). Then it is downhill from there. The decline is quite orderly with\npeaks that follow the trend line down. During early September, however,\nprices drop rapidly on high volume as the bump forms. Prices quickly reach a\nlow of 33.63 before rebounding. Having sliced through the trend line and\nmoving just a bit higher, prices throw back and follow the trend line lower.\nPrices following a trend line lower are not unusual, but what is unusual is that\nprices do not continue their climb. Instead, they drop off the end of the trend\nline and plummet. By late June, they slip to under $20 a share, less than half\nwhat they were at the high.\nWhy did the BARR fail? This formation is not a perfect example of a\nBARR bottom, but few formations are. In this case, the bump height is less\nthan twice the lead-in height. However, the height depends on how the trend\nline is drawn. Drawing a trend line beginning from the peak at point A, the\nbump to lead-in height is about 2 to 1.

As the stock declined from the second high, John drew a tentative trend\nline down connecting them. Soon, he noticed that the stock was descending in\na sort of channel. He drew a second trend line, parallel to the first, that con-\nnected the lows.\nHowever, the stock soon pierced through the second trend line and\nmoved lower. When it declined even further, John thought he recognized a\nBARR bottom forming. He drew a third trend line, parallel to the other two\nand lead-in height apart.\nAs the stock dipped below the lowest trend line, he believed that the\ndecline was at an end. So, the following day he pulled the trigger and bought\n100 shares at 18.25.

    "text": "When the stock neared the top trend line, John calculated the target\nprice, using the old method instead of the highest high in the pattern. He\ncomputed the lead-in height by subtracting the daily low from the trend line at\nits widest part in the first quarter of the formation. He used the low of August\n20, at 24, and subtracted this from the trend line value of 26, measured verti-\ncally. This left him with a lead-in height of $2. John believed that the stock\nwould likely break out at about 21.25, so this gave him a target price of 23.25,\nwhich is the lead-in height added to the breakout price.\nJohn was confident that he could hold out for larger gains. From his pur-\nchase point, he calculated that he would receive at least a 25% return if every-\nthing worked out as planned.\nFor about a month, the stock moved sideways, but this did not alarm him.\nHe even expected the stock to decline a bit and recapture some of its quick\ngains. Secretly he hoped that the stock would soon break out of its trading\nrange and head higher. He was confident that it would move up—it was only a\nquestion of when.\nHe was wrong. Indeed, the stock did break out of its trading range, but it\nheaded lower, not higher. After it approached the top trend line, the stock con-\ntinued down and touched the middle trend line. John knew that a stock often\nretraces 38% to 62% of its gains. He grabbed his calculator and computed the\nretrace value.\nThe stock reached a high of 21.43 in a straight-line run from the low at\n18, a rise of about 3.50 points. Now the stock was retracing the gains and had\nmoved down to 18.75, a 78% retrace. Clearly, this was out of the realm of a\nsimple retrace. John suspected that a trend change had occurred, but hoped\nthat the pause he was seeing as it touched the middle trend line would give the\nstock support and call an end to the decline. For a while, it did. The stock\npaused for 3 days at the trend line then started moving lower again. It quickly\nfell below the purchase price and headed down.\nAlthough John had purchased the stock as a short-term play, he con-\nvinced himself that he really liked the company and would not mind holding it\nfor the long term. Now, at least, that is what it would take for him to recoup\nhis losses and get out at breakeven.\nThe stock moved through the third trend line, heading lower. The easy\ngame was now turning into a disaster. John first considered selling on Decem-\nber 11, when the stock reached 12.75, for a 30% loss. He delayed the selling\ndecision by saying that the holding was a long-term one and he should expect\nto come across such declines in the short term.\nThe next day, the stock closed higher, and it gave him renewed hope.\nIndeed, it closed even higher the following day. But the 2-day recovery was an\nillusion and the stock declined again. As it plunged below 12.75, John threw up\nhis hands and told his broker to dump the dog. He received a fill at 12.25, the\nlow for the day. Two days later, the stock bottomed out at about 10.75. From\nthe buy point, John lost 35%.\nSample Trade\n129",

He extended the\nBARR trend line downward (Figure 7.7) and noticed that a new, larger BARR\nhad formed. After suffering through the large bump, the stock moved higher\nuntil it touched the BARR trend line. Then, the stock followed it lower, unable\nto pierce the resistance line.\nDuring the week of March 27, 1992, the stock closed above the trend line\nfor the first time in months. The BARR was complete and a confirmed break-\nout was occurring. Did John buy the stock? No. For several months, he\nwatched its progress as it moved higher almost week after week. Disgusted, he\nquit following the stock.\nIn April 1994, John took another look at the stock and was surprised to\nsee that it continued moving higher. It had just reached a high of 50.13, a\nclimb of almost 370%. He grabbed his calculator and realized that his mistake\ncost him over $3,000.\nWhat did he do wrong? Several things. He did not wait for the BARR to\npierce the trend line and move higher. If he had, he would have purchased\ncloser to the low, saving him precious capital. Next, he did not cut his losses\nshort. After he bought the stock, he should have determined his sell point. The\nmiddle trend line would have been a good place for a stop-loss order. In this\ncase, it would have taken him out of the stock at about 17.88, a small decline\nfrom the purchase price of 18.25.

    "text": "If you were thinking of buying stock in a company, wouldn’t it be wonderful if\nyou knew the purchase price would be less tomorrow? Of course! But how do\nyou predict tomorrow’s price? That is the problem I was researching when I\ndiscovered the bump-and-run reversal top formation. I was trying to figure out\na reliable way to determine if tomorrow’s price would be higher or lower than\ntoday’s and by how much.\nI tried all sorts of mathematical games to boost the accuracy of the pre-\ndiction with only limited success. Then I moved to the visual world. I drew a\ntrend line along a stock chart and wondered if I could determine how far prices\nwould decline below the line. I looked at many stock charts and trend lines try-\ning to see if there was a relationship between a trend line and the breakdown\nof the trend. That is when I discovered it: the bump-and-run formation—\nBARF for short. I toyed with the idea of leaving the name as is but decided that\nthe investment community would not believe the veracity of the new forma-\ntion. So, I changed the name to bump-and-run reversal (BARR), a slightly\nmore descriptive and palatable acronym.\nTour\nAs I looked at the various trend lines, I discovered that pronounced break-\ndowns share several characteristics. Look at Figure 8.1, a good BARR example.\nThe overall formation reminds me of a mountain range. The foothills at the\nstart of the formation are low and subdued, not venturing too far above the up-\nsloping plain. Volume at the start of the formation is high but quickly recedes.\nThe mountains themselves rise well above the foothills on high volume.\nInvestor enthusiasm continues as prices round over at the top, then diminishes\non the far side. When the mountains end, prices decline sharply and continue\nmoving down. That is a BARR. Prices bump-up, round over, and run back\ndown again. The formation is the visual representation of momentum. The\nbase of the formation follows a trend line that always slopes upward. It signals\ninvestors’ eagerness to acquire the stock. As each day goes by, investors bid\nhigher to reluctant sellers and the price rises.\nOther momentum players eventually notice the rise in the stock price.\nMany jump on the bandwagon the day after a surprisingly good earnings\nannouncement. That is when the bump begins. Volume spikes upward along\nwith the stock price. Quickly rising prices entice others to join the fray \nand that, in turn, sends the stock even higher. As momentum increases, \nprices jump to form a new, higher-sloping trend line. Then things start go-\ning wrong.\nSupply catches up with demand. As that happens, the rise slows and the\nsmart money turns cautious. Investor enthusiasm wanes and the war between\nsupply and demand turns. The stock rounds over and starts heading down.\nTour\n133",

Sometimes there is a pause and some-\ntimes prices just plunge straight through the resistance line, as illustrated \nin Figure 8.1.\nOnce prices pierce the trend line, volume increases as investors dump the\nstock.

In the figure, a trend line drawn below the lows in the\nstock extends until it intersects prices as they decline in May. Volume is high\nat the start of the pattern and the trend is up. That is a key consideration:\nPrices must be rising. The trend line should be approximately 30 degrees, but\nthe degree of slope depends on the scaling used to view the chart. If the trend\nline is flat or nearly so, it is not a good BARR candidate. A rising trend line shows\ninvestor enthusiasm for the stock. However, the trend line should not be too\nsteep either. Steep trend lines (over 60 degrees or so) do not allow enough\nroom for the bump to complete properly.\nLead-in, lead-in height. The first part of the formation, called the lead-\nin phase, leads to the bump phase. The lead-in phase should be at least 1 month\nlong and usually falls in the 2- to 3-month range, but can be considerably\nlonger. Prices oscillate up and down in this phase and have a range of at least $1\nas measured from the highest high to the trend line. This range, called the lead-\nin height, is calculated using prices from the first quarter of the formation.\nFigure 8.1, for example, shows that the highest high during the first quar-\nter of the formation occurs on January 12, 1994, at 25.63.

The trend line usually rises at about\n30–45 degrees (although this varies with scaling). Avoid trend\nlines that are too steep (over 60 degrees): There is not enough\nroom for the bump.\nLead-in, lead-in height\nThe lead-in is the section just before prices move up sharply in\nthe bump phase. Lead-in prices should have a range of at least\n$1 (preferably $2 or more), as measured from the highest high\nto the trend line, vertically, during the first quarter of the\noverall formation length. Minimum lead-in length is 1 month\nwith no maximum value.\nRounded bump\nPrices rise up (trend line slope is 45–60 degrees or more) on\nhigh volume usually after a favorable event (unexpectedly good\nearnings, an analyst recommends or upgrades the stock, higher\nstore sales, that sort of thing). Prices eventually round over and\ndecline back to the 30 degree trend line. The bump must be at\nleast twice the lead-in height, measured from highest high to\nthe trend line, vertically.\nDownhill run\nAfter returning to the trend line, prices may bounce back up\nand form additional bumps or slide along the trend line.

The height is important because the minimum bump height and target\nprice, calculated later, use this value. A more accurate approach is to use the\nlargest distance from the trend line to the high, which is not necessarily found\nbetween the highest high and the trend line. Use whatever method makes you\nfeel comfortable.\nDuring the lead-in phase, subdued price action looks as if the stock is\ngathering strength for the bump phase. Prices do not move very far away from\nthe trend line and usually appear rounded. If you visualize the formation as a\nmountain range, the lead-in phase represents the foothills.\nVolume during the lead-in phase is high at the start. Often this is due to\nevents that occur just before the formation begins. Volume drops off until the\nstart of the bump, when it suddenly rises. The higher share turnover and\nexpanding enthusiasm for the stock forces prices up. In Figure 8.1, this price\nrise occurs on February 17 and is accompanied by volume that is the highest in\nhalf a year.\nRounded bump. Prices jump up at the bump start and quickly rise from\na low of 26.50 to a high of 34.38 during late March. Volume remains high\nthroughout this period then quickly tapers off as prices round over at the top.\nMany times, the top takes on the appearance of a head-and-shoulders forma-\ntion or a double or triple top. If you recognize any of these formations on your\nchart, ignore the BARR top formation and obey the implications of the indi-\nvidual formations.\nThe bump height, as measured from the highest high to the trend line,\nshould be at least twice the lead-in height. In this example, the bump height is\n8 (that is, 34.38–26.38). This is more than twice the lead-in height of 1.38.\nThe reason for the minimum two-to-one ratio is arbitrary. The idea is to\nmake sure that investor enthusiasm and, hence, momentum are getting carried\naway. An up-sloping trend line that turns into a bump with a higher sloping\ntrend line emphasizes the rising momentum. Sustaining such unbounded\nenthusiasm for too long is difficult and the stock price eventually declines. In\nFigure 8.1, that is exactly what happens. Prices round over and start heading\ndown. Sometimes the decline is orderly and sometimes it is choppy. In nearly\nall cases, prices return to the trend line. Once there, the stock may do several\nthings. Fairly often prices bump up again, and that is called a BARR with a dual\nbump or a dual BARR. Occasionally, a dual BARR consists of several bumps\nbut the result is still the same. Prices eventually fall below the trend line.\nDownhill run. Sometimes prices slide up along the trend line for a\nmonth or so before continuing down. At other times, prices drop straight\nthrough the trend line, turn around and climb again, before ultimately drop-\nping. In a few rare cases, prices descend from the bump high and never make\nit back to the trend line before moving higher. These cases commonly appear\non weekly or monthly price charts.\n136\nBump-and-Run Reversal Tops",

In a bull market, the S&P 500 index\nclimbed 8%, and in a bear market, the index dropped 11%. Notice how a\nstrong bear market helped the average BARR decline 27%.\nDays to ultimate low. In a bull market, it takes just over 2 months (68\ndays) to reach the ultimate low, but in a bear market, the drop takes 39 days.\nThus, patterns in a bear market have prices that drop farther in less time, mean-\ning a steeper decline. This finding suggests that if you own a stock with a BARR\ntop and prices confirm by closing below the trend line, sell immediately. Oth-\nerwise, the price riptide may drag your profitable position into a losing one.\nTable 8.3 lists failure rates for BARR tops. The failures start small, espe-\ncially in a bear market. Just one pattern, or 1%, fails to drop at least 5%. As one\nmight expect, the failure rates in a bear market are below those of the bull mar-\nket. Half the patterns in a bear market will fail to drop at least 25%. In a bull\nmarket, the halfway mark passes at about 18%, meaning half the patterns will\nfail to decline more than 18%. Compared to other bearish chart patterns, these\nfailure rates are small.\nOne way to use the table is with the measure rule. Later, in Trading Tac-\ntics I discuss the rule, but suppose it predicts a decline from 20 to 15, or 25%.\nHow likely is it that prices will actually decline that far? Table 8.3 shows the\nanswer. In a bull market, 73% will fail to drop at least 25% and in a bear mar-\nket, 59% will fail. Thus, in both markets, price is unlikely to make a 25% drop.\nTable 8.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics for \nBARR tops.\nStatistics\n139\nTable 8.3\nFailure Rates\nMaximum Price \nBull Market, \nBear Market, \nDecline (%)\nDown Breakout\nDown Breakout\n5 (breakeven)\n34 or 5%\n1 or 1%\n10\n134 or 20%\n6 or 6%\n15\n275 or 41%\n27 or 26%\n20\n386 or 57%\n45 or 43%\n25\n490 or 73%\n61 or 59%\n30\n569 or 85%\n72 or 69%\n35\n610 or 91%\n85 or 82%\n50\n662 or 98%\n99 or 95%\n75\n673 or 100%\n104 or 100%\nOver 75\n673 or 100%\n104 or 100%",

Occa-\nsionally, one will begin a rapid climb on high volume and enter the bump phase.\nWarning and sell lines. By definition, a BARR is only valid when the\nbump height, as measured from the highest high to the trend line, is at least\ntwice the lead-in height. Two lines parallel to the trend line assist in that deter-\nmination. The first line, called the warning line, is lead-in height above the\ntrend line. A second trend line, parallel to the first two and lead-in height\nabove the warning line, is the sell line.\nThe warning line serves as a signal that a BARR may be forming. Once\nprices move solidly above the line, consider doing any fundamental or techni-\ncal research on the stock to prepare yourself for a sale.\nBy the time prices touch the sell line, you should have a firm grasp of the\ncompany, industry, and market outlook. The sell line is not an automatic sell\ntrigger, but it does confirm that a BARR is present. The sell line touch indi-\ncates that the momentum players have the upper hand. The game could con-\ntinue for several weeks or months before the downhill run phase sets in, so do\nnot be in too much of a rush to sell. Since most bumps appear rounded, there\nis ample time to sell the stock. By waiting, you are giving the momentum play-\ners additional time to push the stock even higher.\nHowever, there are situations when you will want to pull the trigger\nquickly. If the company, industry, or market look dicey, then perhaps it is time\nto take profits. You might not be selling at the exact top, but you never go\nbroke taking a profit. Also, if the bump does not appear rounded, then consider\nselling. A quick decline often follows a quick rise.\nFigure 8.5 shows the BARR trend line and the parallel warning and sell\nlines, each line lead-in height from the other.

If you owned the stock\ndepicted in Figure 8.5 and sold it when prices pierced the sell line moving\ndown, you would not have sold at the top. However, you would have avoided\nthe 40% decline that followed. The decline also points out that it can be easy\nto make money, on paper, in the stock market but difficult to keep it.\nMeasure rule. Figure 8.5 also shows the measure rule in action. The\nmeasure rule is a method used to predict the minimum price decline of the\nstock. For BARRs in this study, about 8 out of 10 stocks decline below the pre-\ndicted price.\nTo compute the predicted minimum decline, calculate the lead-in height\nby splitting the formation along the trend line into four equal parts. In the first\nquarter of the formation, compute the height from the highest high to the\ntrend line, measured vertically (or use the widest distance between the two).\nSubtract the result from where the trend line is pierced, heading down (the\nbreakout). In Figure 8.5, the lead-in height is 3.50 (that is, 21.50–18). The tar-\nget price is thus 21.63 (25.13–3.50), reached during the week of the breakout.\nAfter the breakout, the stock rises back up to meet the trend line before\nresuming its decline.

She did not notice it at first, but by\nmid-September, Jenny spotted a BARR forming in a stock she owned (Figure\n8.6). She spent an hour searching the Internet for anything she could find\nabout the company. She checked the fundamentals, analysts’ recommenda-\ntions, insider buying and selling patterns, and anything else she could think of.\nShe reviewed the reasons she bought the stock. Using the Peter Lynch\nstyle of investing—that of buying a stock one is familiar with—held a special\nappeal to her. She liked shopping at the grocery store chain and the products\nthey sold were something she could really sink her teeth into. She felt com-\nfortable owning the stock.\nJenny printed out the price chart and examined the BARR in detail. She\ndrew the trend line along the bottom, divided the length of it into four equal\nparts, and computed the lead-in height. Then she drew the warning and sell\nlines parallel to the trend line, each separated by the lead-in height. She com-\nputed the minimum target price to which the stock was likely to decline. From\nthe current price of 30, the target price was 23, a decline of almost 25%.

    "text": "She looked back through the chart price history and searched for support\nzones so she could better gauge the area where any decline might stop. The\nfirst support area was in the 23 to 24 zone, where a prior advance had paused.\nInterestingly, that was also the predicted decline point for the stock. If the\nstock fell below the support point, she noticed a second, more robust support\narea between 20 and 22.\nWhat of the possible reward? How high could she expect the stock to\nrise? Long-term price charts were no help as the stock was making new highs\nalmost daily. Jenny shrugged her shoulders as there was no way to determine\nwhere the rise would stop. Her only guess was that it might pause at 35, 40, or\n45, price points where investors might decide to sell. Any one of those points\ncould turn the stock downward, she decided. Even the current 30 level might\nbe the highest price the stock sees.\nAfter her analysis was complete, she was still confident that the stock held\npromise of additional gains. As with any stock caught by upward momentum,\nthere was no telling how high the stock would climb before it stopped. She\ndecided to hang onto the stock. If the stock declined to the warning line, \nshe would sell it. She placed a stop-loss order at 27.50, the current value of the\nwarning line.\nDuring late September and into the start of October, the stock followed\nthe sell line upward. On October 12, the stock jumped upward again. After a\nweek or so, Jenny was able to draw another sell line parallel to the original\nBARR trend line that intersected stock prices. She decided that should the\nstock fall to the lower sell line, she would dump the stock. She raised her stop-\nloss point to 31. But the stock did not return to the lower sell line.\nThe stock reached a minor high of 34.38 on October 19, then retraced\nsome of its prior gains. It curled around and reached a low of 32.88 before\nturning around. Jenny printed out another price chart and drew a new trend\nline. This line had a slope of about 60 degrees. She smiled as the BARR was\nperforming exactly as predicted.\nDuring the first part of December, prices pierced the 60 degree trend line\nwhen the stock began moving sideways. Jenny suspected that the rise was nearly\nover, but one could never tell for sure until it was too late. She decided that should\nthe stock decline below the latest sell line, she would close out her position.\nThe stock moved up again. A few days after Christmas, the stock reached\na new high of 39.75 and Jenny was able to draw another sell line. During the\nnext 2 weeks, the stock declined to the lower sell line, then rebounded to chal-\nlenge its recent high. On January 15, it peaked at 39.88, a smidgen below the\n40 resistance number she estimated earlier.\nTo Jenny, the day looked like a one-day reversal, but she could not be sure.\nTaken together, the two highest points looked like a double top, but the reces-\nsion between them was not deep enough to qualify and the two peaks were a bit\ntoo close together. Still, it was a warning sign and it made her nervous.\nSample Trade\n147",

The higher left lip is a change from the first edition of this Encyclopedia\nwhere cups with a higher right lip performed better. I believe the difference is\nfrom the change in methodology and a larger sample size. \nTour\nThe cup-with-handle formation was popularized by William J. O’Neil in his\nbook, How to Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill, 1988). He gives a couple of\nexamples such as that shown in Figure 9.1. The stock climbed 295% in about 2\nmonths (computed from the right cup lip to the ultimate high). Unfortunately,\nit does not meet O’Neil’s criteria for a cup-with-handle formation. I discuss my\ninterpretation of his criteria in a moment, but let us first take a closer look at the\nchart pattern. The stock began rising in early August at a price of about 5.50 and\nclimbed steadily until it bumped up in early December. Volume, incidentally,\nwas very high for the stock at this stage. The stock climbed robustly then\nrounded over and plunged back through an earlier trend line. It completed a\nbump-and-run reversal (BARR). During its climb, the stock reached a high of\n26.88 during late December and a low of 12.38 after the BARR top—a loss of\n54%. The rise and decline formed the left side of the cup. Over the next 2\nmonths, prices meandered upward and pierced the old high during late March.\nThe rise to the old high completed the right side of the cup.\n150\nCup with Handle\nDiana Corp.

This movement formed the cup handle\n(incidentally, the handle in this formation is a high, tight flag formation). Vol-\nume during formation of the handle was down sloping—higher at the start and\ntrending lower. When prices rose above the cup lip, a breakout occurred. This\naccompanied a surge in volume that propelled prices higher. However, a week\nafter the breakout, prices threw back to the handle top before continuing\nupward. This throwback allowed nimble investors the opportunity to enter\nlong positions or add to existing ones.

    "text": "In the first edition of this book, I applied as many of his guidelines as I\ncould and found that fewer than 10% of the patterns I considered valid cups\nwere chosen. Plus, the performance of the selected few was not as good as the\ncups I found using the Bulkowski guidelines shown in Table 9.1. For more\ninformation about the cup with handle pattern, consult O’Neil’s book. \nHere is a brief review of the guidelines I found important.\nRise before cup is at least 30%. As I was selecting cup-with-handle pat-\nterns, it became apparent that locating cups during an uptrend was important.\nSo I used O’Neil’s minimum rise to the left cup lip of 30%. To measure this,\nI applied the same method as for finding the trend start (see the Glossary for a\ndefinition) and reviewed those that fell short of 30%. If the trend start using\nthe mechanical method was shy (usually by just a few percentage points) of the\nrequired 30% but the price trend appeared longer on examination, I accepted\nthe pattern. Just 15 of 471 patterns (3%) were in this category.\nU-shaped cup, handle duration. I removed all V-shaped cups and kept\nthe U-shaped ones. I am not sure about the performance effect of this. Also\nremoved were those cups with handles shorter than 7 days (5 trading days). A\ncup without a handle is a rounding bottom. I considered the handle length as\nthe distance from the right cup lip to the breakout.\nCup duration. I used a strict interpretation of O’Neil’s cup duration.\nRemoved were short cups (fewer than 7 weeks) and overly long ones (over \n65 weeks). \nHandles form in upper half of cup. I used a more lax interpretation of\nwhere the handle forms on the cup. In other words, I visually inspected the\ncups to be sure prices in the handle drifted no lower than halfway down the\ncup. I removed those drifting lower (include all with downward breakouts).\nWhen measuring distance, use an arithmetic chart, not a semilogarith-\nmic chart.\nCup lips near same price. Finally, I selected cups with lips (tops) at\napproximately the same price level. Cups with uneven lips are better classified\nas scallops. I assign no hard percentages to the difference. Use your own judg-\nment and the figures in this chapter as guides.\nFigure 9.2 shows another good example of the cup-with-handle pattern.\nThe cup gently rounds over and climbs just beyond the old high then pauses.\nPrices drift down in the handle, along with a down-trending volume pattern\nbefore the breakout. Then volume surges and prices move smartly upward.\nTwo days after the breakout, prices move marginally lower again and enter\nthe region of the right cup lip. After a brief throwback, prices are soon on\ntheir way again. Less than 2 months later, the stock tops out at 15.50 for a \nrise of 22%.\nIf you look on either side of the cup in Figure 9.2 you will find two addi-\ntional cups (portions of which are shown) that fail.

I\nlooked closer at this observation and found that there were 6 cups involved\n(bull market only) and most showed gains any trader would love.\nThrowbacks. A throwback occurs about half the time if you average the\ntwo values. This is still too infrequent to rely on. In other words, do not depend\non a throwback allowing you another opportunity to buy into the situation.\nWhen a throwback occurs, it takes 11 days for the stock to return to the\nbreakout price. In a bull market, a throwback hurts performance. In a bear\nmarket, a throwback helps performance, but the sample count is low. In most\nchart pattern types, throwbacks are detrimental.\nGaps. Gaps help performance in a bull market but hurt it in a bear mar-\nket, as Table 9.4 shows. \nTable 9.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high.\nYou can see that in a bull market, over half of all cups take more than 70 days\nto reach the ultimate high. In a bear market, only a third of the patterns will\nstill be climbing toward the high after 70 days.\nOn the other end of the scale, few patterns flame out early. Usually a\nquick rise to the ultimate high does not result in a large gain, so higher num-\nbers on the right of the table are a plus. The table shows that 15% of the cups\nin a bear market will top out in the first week. Half the patterns will drop at\nleast 20% before day 35. The 20% decline is part of the definition of the ulti-\nmate high. See the Glossary for more details on the ultimate high. \nTable 9.6 shows size-related statistics.\nHeight. Do tall patterns perform better than short ones as they do in\nmany other chart pattern types? Yes. To compute cup height, measure from\nthe higher of the cup lips to the formation low, and then divide by the high of\n158\nCup with Handle\nTable 9.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market \n15%\n3%\n10%\n10%\n10%\n5%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n5%\n34%\nBull market\n10%\n5%\n4%\n5%\n2%\n1%\n4%\n4%\n3%\n4%\n57%",

The traditional method involves determining the\nheight of the formation from lowest low in the cup to the high at the right cup\nlip. Adding the difference to the high at the right cup lip results in the target\nprice. However, this method only has a 50% success rate (half the formations\nreach their price targets in a bull market—fewer, 27%, in a bear market). For\na better target, compute the cup height and take half of it. Then continue as\nbefore. The stock reaches the new, lower-priced target 76% of the time in a\nbull market; 55% in a bear market. This is still shy of the 80% number I con-\nsider reliable, but it gives a more accurate indication of the likely price rise.\nFigure 9.6 is an example of the two measure rules in practice. Compute\nthe cup height by taking the difference between the right cup high (point A at\n19) and the cup low (point B at 10). Add the difference (9) to the right cup lip\nto get the price target (28). Mid-May sees prices hit the target but plummet the\nfollowing week.\nA more conservative price target uses half the formation height.

One day, he overheard them talking about the stock\npictured in Figure 9.6. At first he did not think much about it until he looked\ndeeper. That is when he saw it: a cup-with-handle pattern.\nHe was not convinced the stock was a good trade, and but did not have\nthe money to buy it anyway. He decided to paper trade it to see what he could\nlearn. On the daily time scale, he saw an inner cup forming at point C, so that\nis the one he decided to trade.\nWeek after week, he waited for the buy signal but it did not come. Even-\ntually, the stock climbed above the right cup lip but he missed it. When he\npulled up the stock chart on his computer, a throwback had already occurred.\nSo he waited for prices to climb above the cup lip again.\nThat happened on May 9, his girlfriend’s birthday. Sensing a positive\nomen, he made a notation to buy the stock, on paper, at the closing price the\nfollowing day (filled at 15.25). When he met his girlfriend the next day, she was\nnot impressed with the birthday present he gave her, and the stock closed\nlower as well.\nTwo weeks later, the stock was moving up. Cody placed his stop 0.15\nbelow the handle low, at 14.38 (point D, which also marks the purchase point).\nWhen the stock climbed above the outer cup, he raised the stop to 0.15 below\nthe handle low or 17.50.

I searched through my databases for the pattern, created some identi-\nfication guidelines, and then gathered statistics. The pattern performed better\nthan I thought.\nAs the accompanying Results Snapshot shows, in a bear market the pat-\nterns have a 2% breakeven failure rate—very low. The average decline is 26%,\na good showing for a bearish pattern. \nThe measure rule, the height of the pattern subtracted from the right cup\nrim, fails.

So\nI changed the measure rule to use the handle height applied to the low at the\nright rim. This approach works better, as the Snapshot shows, but still falls well\nshort of the 80% benchmark.

In the figure, the handle is from point B until almost May. The median\nhandle length is 40 days, so that gives you some idea of how long handles are.\nExpect variations.\nCup retrace.

The next two most common\nretrace amounts were 35% and 60%, respectively. All of these numbers are\nclosing in on their respective Fibonacci retrace values of 50%, 38%, and 62%.\nFor example, Figure 10.2 shows the retrace as the distance from B to D\ncompared to the distance from B to C. The distance from B to D is 2.16 (6.90\n– 4.74). The distance from B to C is 7.70 (or 12.44 – 4.74). The retrace is the\nratio of these two values, 28%, or 2.16/7.70.

The handle has an upward bounce\nthat measures 61%, close to the Fibonacci retrace of 62%. Even the breakout\nis downward, as required by the guidelines. However, prices drop just 3% before\nrebounding. What happened?\nLooking back on the weekly scale shows extensive support beginning in\nmid-1999 (not shown) and lasting for a year. Price could not pierce 6.50 (mov-\ning up) and stay above that level for any length of time, creating a support zone.\nThat price is also where the rim of the icup formed. When the downward \nbreakout occurred, prices ran into stiff support and stopped declining 3%\nbelow the breakout. \nThis is a good example of how important stops are when trading. After\nopening a short position, place a stop just above the prior high or above a\nnearby resistance zone. Do not place it too close or you will be stopped out on\nnormal price volatility. Using a stop would have saved a trader from an embar-\nrassing loss.\nFocus on Failures\n169\nInverted Cup\nHandle\n96 Dec\nAug\nSep\nOct\nJan 97\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nDekalb Genetics (Food Processing, NYSE, DKB)\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n31\n33\n35\n37\n39\n41\n43\n45\n47\n18\n17\n16\nFigure 10.4\nThis is not an inverted cup-with-handle because price fails to drop\nbelow the right cup rim and confirm the pattern.",

Does performance change depending on\nwhere in the yearly price range the breakout occurs? The answer is mixed. In\na bull market, the best performing patterns have breakouts near the yearly low.\nIn a bear market, the middle of the range works best, but the sample count uses\n29 patterns. With additional patterns, the results may change.\nPullbacks. A pullback occurs about half the time. That is not often enough\nin which to formulate a trading plan (such as wait for the pullback before short-\ning). It takes, on average, nearly two weeks for the stock to return to the break-\nout price, completing the pullback. \nWhen a pullback occurs, performance suffers. You can see the effect in the\ntable. Look for nearby support zones—regions that might repel the downward\nprice trend before taking a position in the stock.\nGaps. Icups with gaps show improved performance after the breakout, but\nthe differences are slight. \nTable 10.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate low. For\nexample, in a bear market, 29% of the patterns bottom in the first week. Nearly\nhalf (47% or 29 + 18) reach the ultimate low in less than 2 weeks. A quarter of the\npatterns in a bull market are still searching for the ultimate low after 2.5 months.\nNotice the slight rise in the number bottoming out at day 42 (bear mar-\nket) and 49 (bull market). Keep an eye out for a trend change 6 to 7 weeks after\nthe breakout.\nTable 10.6 shows size-related statistics.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform better than short ones. To use this obser-\nvation, compute the formation height by taking the difference between the top\nof the cup and the lower of the two rims and then divide by the price of the right\nrim low. If the result is higher than the median, the pattern is tall.\nWidth. Narrow patterns perform slightly better than wide ones. I used\nthe median length as the separator between narrow and wide.\nAverage formation length. Icups are wide beasts—about 4 to 5 months\nlong—on average. Icups in a bull market are narrower than in a bear market,\nbut the reason for this is not clear.\nHeight and width combinations. In both markets, icups that are both tall\nand narrow perform best. The worst performance comes from icups that are\nshort and wide, so you will want to avoid those.\nStatistics\n173\nTable 10.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate Low\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market\n29%\n18%\n13%\n10%\n5%\n6%\n3%\n4%\n1%\n2%\n9%\nBull market\n24%\n9%\n9%\n8%\n7%\n4%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n3%\n25%",

Did it meet the iden-\ntification guidelines listed in Table 10.1? Quickly running through them, we find\nthat price leading to the pattern was drifting down in a bull market. A down-\nward price trend was good as you want to trade with the trend, but it would have\nbeen better if the pattern appeared in a bear market. The cup looked rounded\nwith rims uneven but not too apart in price. The handle showed a distinct bump\nup but some distance from the cup. She did not know if this made any difference.\nThe handle retrace measured 69%, higher than the Fibonacci retrace of 62%. \nNext she reviewed the “For Best Performance” list to improve her odds of\na successful trade. Was a pullback likely? No (good), because there was no price\naction as far back as late 1992 and little underlying support in the two years\nbefore that. Was the pattern tall? No (bad). The pattern high was at 10.63, the\nlow at 8.13, and the breakout at 8.38. The result was 29.83%, just shy of the\n31.93% median, making the pattern short. Was the pattern wide?

Thus, you will want\nto take profits and not buy and hold. \nDownward breakouts perform well for bearish patterns, dropping 21%.\nThe 44% average decline in a bear market is based on too few samples to be\nbelievable. In fact, many of the statistics use few samples, so be careful drawing\nconclusions. \nTour\nFigure 11.1 shows an example of what a diamond bottom looks like. Notice that\nthe price trends downward into the pattern then the diamond appears and\nprices reverse. Prices dropping into the pattern mean it is a diamond bottom\nand not a top.\n180\nDiamond Bottoms",

The price range narrows until the\nbreakout occurs. \nVolume throughout the formation is diminishing. The breakout usually\nsports a significant rise in volume. Figure 11.1 shows high volume on the break-\nout when prices gap through the diamond boundary. In less than 3 months, the\nstock climbs over 20% to a high of 22.25. \nA diamond bottom represents the struggle between buyers and sellers. Buy-\ning demand pushes prices up to a new minor high until selling pressure forces\nprices back down. If the selling pressure is strong enough, prices drop to a new\nminor low. The widening pattern continues, but usually not for many swings. \nOn the other half of the diamond, greedy holders—seeing a good price for\nthe stock—sell, and the price rise stops, turns around, and drops. Sellers buy but\ndo so before prices make a new low. They are excited about the stock and buy\nin before prices can reverse and leave them without a position. This activity\nblunts the downward momentum and creates a higher minor low. Thus, prices\nbegin narrowing on the far side of the diamond. \nEventually, one of the warring parties will win, and overwhelming buying\ndemand or selling pressure will cause prices to break out of the pattern. Prices\ncontinue in the breakout direction until they pause several points beyond the\ndiamond boundary. For upward breakouts, the pause may be frightening enough\nthat holders sell, driving the price back to the diamond trend line (a throwback). \nFor downward breakouts, buying demand from traders believing they are\ngetting the stock at fire sale prices creates a pullback.

It sounds\neasy, but it is not (unless you like losing money).\nIdentification Guidelines\nHow do you identify a diamond bottom? Review the identification characteris-\ntics shown in Table 11.1. \nPrior price trend. Since we are dealing with diamond bottoms and not\ntops, the prevailing price trend is downward leading to the diamond. \nThe hardest part of identifying any pattern is seeing the shape prices make.\nFor diamonds, they are especially difficult to identify. However, they occur\nmany times at price turning points. Thus, look for diamond bottoms at the end\nof a downward price trend. Rarely, diamonds appear in the middle of the trend\nand prices continue lower instead of reversing.\nDiamond shape. When prospecting for diamonds look for prices to widen\nout over time forming higher highs and lower lows. The price pattern should\nlook like a broadening bottom chart pattern. Then, prices narrow, forming lower\nhighs and higher lows. The second half should look like a symmetrical triangle.\nIf you draw trend lines around the minor lows and highs, the result should\nappear diamond shaped. More likely, the diamond’s top or bottom will be\npushed to one side, making it appear as though the chart pattern is leaning over. \nVolume trend. Volume usually trends downward over the course of the\npattern, but need not. Do not discard a chart pattern simply because volume\ntrends upward instead of downward.

Again, do not discard a diamond because the breakout\nvolume is light instead of heavy.\nHere are three examples of diamonds. Figure 11.2 shows the first exam-\nple.

The breakout occurs the day price closes outside\nthe diamond boundary. \nSpecifically, the diamond top in Figure 11.6 shows a height of 7.62. That\nis, 79.25–71.63, the high minus the low. Since the breakout is downward, sub-\ntract the result from the breakout price. That gives a target of 65.88 or 73.50–\n7.62 (the breakout price minus the height). \nQuick rise/fall. Figure 11.6 also shows an alternative way of guessing the\nmagnitude of the rise or decline. When prices shoot upward (in the case of the\ndiamond top, pictured), a quick decline often follows, which takes prices back\nto the launch point. I show this as the “Expected Decline” in the figure. \nThe diamond bottom shows a similar situation. Prices make a steep drop\ninto the pattern and soar back out in a similar trend. They stop climbing near the\nlaunch point (shown as the “Expected Rise”).\nWait for breakout. Before you invest in a stock showing a chart pattern,\nwait for the breakout. Since diamonds break out either up or down, you can-\nnot predict the breakout direction with much certainty. Thus, wait for the\nbreakout—a close outside the pattern boundary—before taking a position. Yes,\npremature breakouts do occur but they are rare.

    "text": "Sample Trade\nScott graduated from engineering college and took his first professional job at\na growing software company. The job pays well, but he has many school loans\nand a mountain of dept. He thought of using his paycheck to keep ahead of the\nbills while depending on the bull market to furnish the luxuries.\nHe had his eye on a new stereo system and wanted it for a party he was\nhosting during the Fourth of July festivities. That did not leave him much time,\nso he searched for a chart pattern he could trade profitably. He chose the dia-\nmond bottom shown in Figure 11.6. Scott first noticed the diamond in May, a\nfew days before the breakout. He believed that the price would not decline below\n69.88, 0.12 below the round number of 70 and at the same level as a couple of\nprice peaks in January.\nRisking just $0.75 with a possible reward of $3.75 gave him a risk to reward\nratio of 1:5. If everything worked as planned, he would make a tidy sum, enough\nto buy the stereo.\nThe day after the stock broke out upward, he bought and received a fill at\n71.75 (near point C in Figure 11.6). That was higher than he liked, but with\nthe strength shown, he was sure the trade would work out. Scott dutifully\nplaced his stop-loss order at 69.88 with his broker. Three days later the stock\nclosed at 75, above the target price. He dropped by the music store just to fon-\ndle the knobs and flip the switches of his dream machine.\nThen things began going wrong. The stock closed down nearly $3 to 72.13.\nIt dropped to 71.38 the next day and made a lower low a day later. Suddenly,\nScott was losing money and his stereo pipe dream was in danger of plugging.\nShould he sell the stock and put off the party for another time?\nLuck was on his side and prices began climbing again. Soon, they were at\n74, but the honeymoon did not last long. Prices completed a symmetrical tri-\nangle but Scott did not see it. They broke out downward through the support\ntrend line (extend the lower right diamond diagonal toward the triangle). The\nstock even gave him another chance to get out at a profit when it attempted a\npullback to the triangle boundary. Scott was busy making party plans and missed\nthe signal. When he received a call from his broker in mid-June reporting that\nthe stop took him out at 69.88, Scott scratched his head and wondered what\nwent wrong. Do you know the answer?\nThe answer is greed. Since he needed money for a stereo, once prices\ncleared the top of the diamond, he should have put a limit order to sell at his\ntarget price. Although this technique limits the profit potential (because you\nget taken out even though the stock may double after that), it allows a trader\nto capture the turn near a high point. I have seen this behavior with event pat-\nterns. Prices shoot up, hit the target and then just as quickly decline. If you do\nnot sell, you lose your profit. An example from my own trading: A few days\nago, a stop-loss order sold my position in Rohm & Haas for a $113 profit in an\nearnings flag trade. If I used my profit target, I would have made $1,000. \n194\nDiamond Bottoms",

Even\nthen, during April and May 1994, prices are buoyed by the support zone at 31\ncreated a year and a half earlier.\nFigure 12.4 shows another example of a diamond top. In the first edition\nof the Encyclopedia, I called this example a failure because prices broke out upward\ninstead of downward. I no longer make that distinction: Breakouts can occur in\nany direction.\nI would expect prices to breakout downward because of the quick rise lead-\ning to the pattern (late January) and drop until they found support around the\n108 level, the price range of the January lows.

The diamond\nshape becomes clear after drawing trend lines along the minor highs and lows.\nLinear regression on the volume trend shows that it tilts downward, as expected.\nThe breakout volume is high, but again, this is not a rule, just an observation.\nA breakout on low volume is fine. In short, the diamond top pictured in Figure\n12.4 is valid. With an upward breakout, I would check for overhead resistance\nto the upward move but this figure does not show any.

    "text": "Focus on Failures \nFigure 12.5 shows a typical diamond top failure. The diamond may look odd\nby its unsymmetrical appearance, but does it qualify as a valid diamond? Yes.\nThe price trend leading to the pattern is up, there are plenty of trend line\ntouches in the pattern, and volume diminishes from being high on the left to low\non the right—all are ingredients of a properly selected diamond top. Breakout\nvolume, however, is timid, falling well short of the peaks posted during the\nprior three days. \nIs low breakout volume the reason why prices failed to descend far (just\n3%)? Maybe. A high volume breakout would have given more confidence to a\nbearish situation and perhaps prevented a pullback. I have noticed that high\nvolume downward breakouts pull back less often than do low volume ones.\nThis makes intuitive sense, as a high volume descent tends to push prices down\nfarther than a low volume one. \nPerhaps the key to this failure is like many others: Support below the pat-\ntern stops the decline. On the weekly chart (not shown), support appears in\nAugust 1996, February 1996, and May 1995, all with prices peaking near 17.\nCoupled with a bullish general market, the rising tide lifted all boats and pre-\nvented this one from sinking.\nBased on this chart, if this were my trade, I would have seen the support\nin July (point A) as a warning sign.

I am sure your eye went first to the bear mar-\nket, up breakout with a 0% failure rate. Look down at the bottom of the col-\numn. I found only 28 patterns. Of course, downward breakouts are more likely\nto happen in a bear market than upward breakouts, as the sample sizes attest (I\nfound 56 patterns with downward breakouts in a bear market).\nFor small moves, diamonds with downward breakouts are the best bets.\nThey have the lowest failure rates (if you exclude the low sample count, bear\nmarket, up breakout column). This changes for moves higher than 20%. For\nlarge moves, patterns in a bull market with an upward breakout show smaller\nfailure rates.\nHow do you make sense of the numbers? Table 12.3 shows how likely it is\nthat your pattern may fail to rise or drop a given amount. For example, in a bull\nmarket, 10% of the diamonds with upward breakouts will fail to rise more than\n5%. Twenty-seven percent will fail to climb 10%.

    "text": "Yearly position, performance. Mapping performance onto the yearly\nprice range, we find mixed results. Bull markets do better when the breakout is\nin the middle of the yearly price range. Bear markets have too few samples to be\nusable. Upward breakouts do better near the yearly low, and downward break-\nouts do better near the yearly high.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. How often do prices throw back (upward\nbreakouts) or pull back (downward breakouts) to the diamond trend line bor-\nder or breakout price? Answer: about half the time.\nThe time to complete the throwback or pullback ranges between 9 and 13\ndays. When a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suffers, as Table 12.4\nshows. Thus, the key to selecting better performing patterns is to search for\nunderlying support or overhead resistance before investing. Nearby support or\nresistance may repel the downward or upward move, respectively.\nGaps. Across the board, gaps hurt performance. By gaps, I mean a price\ngap that occurs on the day price closes outside the pattern boundary (the break-\nout day). The average gap size varies from $0.40 to $0.91 depending on market\nconditions and breakout direction. Other chart patterns show larger gaps asso-\nciated with downward breakouts, but the small sample size may explain the large\ngap size in diamonds with upward breakouts in a bear market.\nTable 12.5 shows a frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high or\nlow. Notice how many diamonds reach the ultimate move in the first few weeks.\nFor example, in a bear market, 55% of those diamonds with downward break-\nouts top out in the first month. At the other end of the table, 13% are still\nsearching for the ultimate low after 70 days (about 2.5 months).\nAlso notice the slight blip around a month into the trade. In a bear market,\nup breakout, 11% of the diamonds top out after 35 days. Skipping down, 14%\nof diamonds in a bear market with downward breakouts bottom around day 42.\nIn fact, all patterns show a slight rise during days 35 or 42.

Add the difference (5.77) to the breakout price (C\nat 41.85, the point at which price pierces the diamond boundary) to get the\ntarget (47.62). Price reaches the target between 69% and 79% of the time. See\nthe Results Snapshot (“Percentage meeting price target”) for the numbers. In\nthis example, the diamond missed the target by falling short.\nHowever, there is an alternative method that sometimes yields more\naccurate results. The method involves looking at the price chart and seeing if\nthere is something to reverse. By this I mean diamonds sometimes form after\na quick run-up in prices. The reversal will usually erase these gains and return\nprices to where they were before the run-up.\nWait for breakout. When trading technical formations like diamond\ntops, it is always safest to wait for the breakout. If you do not wait for the\nbreakout, you may face a situation similar to that shown in Figure 12.4. Instead\nof reversing, prices resume their original trend and the investor, shorting\nbefore the breakout, takes a loss.\nRisk/reward. Before placing a trade, consider the risk/reward ratio. In\nessence, you first identify the support and resistance levels and calculate the\ndifference between those levels and the current price. Trades that result in risk/\nreward ratios of one to two or higher are worth making. With smaller ratios,\nthe risk may be too high to warrant a trade. \nSample Trade\nFigure 12.6 shows a diamond top Lorenzo traded. He first noticed the dia-\nmond well after it formed—during the throwback to be exact. The throw-\nback’s hooking pattern caught his attention, and he searched for a nearby chart\npattern. In this case, he saw a diamond top, but was it a valid diamond or just\ncubic zirconia?\nLorenzo reviewed the identification guidelines and found that prices were\nrising into the pattern, verifying a top. The diamond shape, although pushed\nto one side, had an adequate number of touches of each diamond boundary (the\ntrend lines). Volume receded from the middle of the pattern to the end, so it\nhad a downward trend. In fact, the entire volume shape appeared domed. Dome-\nshaped volume for diamonds in a bull market with an upward breakout was a\ndecent choice (not the best or worst; see Table 12.7). \nBreakout volume was high but nothing to write home about and well below\nthe peaks of a few days earlier. Prices also gapped upward, suggesting buying\nenthusiasm. However, he knew that breakout day gaps resulted in performance\nthat was not as good as those diamonds without gaps. That made him nervous.\nSince the breakout was upward, he checked for overhead resistance and\nsaw the long island in May. Prices tested the region at point D, leading to the\n210\nDiamond Tops",

Thus, it looked likely that prices would throw back\nthere. That meant watching the stock closely and selling when it neared the\ntarget to maximize profits. On the down side, if prices dropped, he would close\nout his position just below the diamond bottom (point B). \nTwo days after prices closed the gap in the throwback, he bought and\nreceived a fill at 43. In the days that followed, the stock dropped, and he knew\nfrom experience that many of his trades either did well immediately or fell\napart. This looked as if it were going to result in a loss. He placed a stop-loss\norder to sell at 37.93. That was below the round number support at 38 and just\nbelow the diamond bottom.\nPrices climbed. When they closed above the prior minor high, point D,\nhe raised his stop to just below point E, a nearby minor low. Prices continued\nhigher for two more days then retraced their gains, attempted another high\n(point F) and then started a long slide. \nFrom experience, Lorenzo knew that a failure of price to make a higher\nhigh (at point F) was a bearish sign, but he hoped price would rebound. It did\nnot. Instead, price gapped down and tripped his stop. The stock sold at 40.98,\nfor a 5% loss.\nWhat did he do wrong? I would not have taken this trade because of the\noverhead resistance. Since there are plenty of chart patterns in other stocks\nunder more promising circumstances, why take one with high risk and limited\nprofit potential? On the plus side, he used a stop-loss order and raised it as\nprices climbed. Eventually, the order took him out for a small loss. That is the\nway it should work when a trade goes bad. Let your profits run and cut your\nlosses short. \nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help you select better per-\nforming diamonds. Refer to the associated table for more information. \n• Correctly identify the pattern using the guidelines—Table 12.1.\n• Downward breakouts occur most often and perform well—Table 12.2.\n• Downward breakouts have the lowest failure rates for small declines, but\nupward breakouts have fewer failures for larger moves—Table 12.3.\n• Throwbacks and pullbacks hurt performance. Avoid trades with nearby\nsupport and resistance zones—Table 12.4.\nFor Best Performance\n211",

First he qualified the pattern as a true double bottom\nby reviewing the identification characteristics listed in Table 13.1. Briefly, the\nstock started down in early January after a long-term uptrend that began in\nFebruary 1995. The twin bottoms were narrow with one-day downward spikes.\nThe rise between bottoms measured 29%; the bottom lows were 1% apart in\nprice and separated by 64 days. Oddly, the right bottom showed higher volume.\nHe placed an order to buy the stock at the confirmation price. Thus, he would\nget in at a good price and received a fill at 20.\nThe stock struggled by moving sideways for a week then achieved liftoff.\nPrice climbed until early June when it started retracing. The retrace turned\ninto a throwback when price pierced the confirmation line at 20. Prices moved\nup again and retraced, forming the handle of a cup-with-handle pattern. Randy\ndrew a down-sloping trend line along the handle, and the day after price closed\nabove the trend line, he bought more, receiving a fill at 22.73.\nHe computed the target price for the AADB (24.50, see the “Measure rule”\nin Table 13.8) and smiled when prices passed that, moving up. Then, he drew\nan up-sloping trend line following the contours of the handle (called the “Sell\nTrendline” in Figure 13.6). He vowed to sell the day after price closed below the\ntrend line, which it did in late November (not shown), and he received a fill at",

After the second bottom,\nprices rise at a steady rate until the confirmation point. Then prices jump up and\npierce the prior minor high at about 40.63. When price closes above the confirma-\ntion line, it signals a valid breakout and confirms the double bottom formation. \nIn this case, as is common for many double bottoms, prices throw back to\nthe breakout point.

A double bottom with a breakout near the yearly high—\nsounds like the best performers take place in an upward price trend like that\nshown in Figure 14.2.\nThrowbacks. The next several rows in Table 14.4 concern throwbacks. Just\nover half the time price throws back to the confirmation price. To complete the\nthrowback, it takes price 9 or 10 days. An interesting finding is that a throwback\nhurts performance. Thus, look for overhead resistance before trading a stock.\nGaps. Breakout day gaps hurt performance in a bull market but help it in\na bear market. However, the numbers are close, so they may be likely to change. \nTable 14.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high as\nmeasured from the breakout date. For example, 23% of AEDBs in a bear mar-\nket and 12% in a bull market reach the ultimate high in the first week. In two\nweeks’ time, 27% and 17%, respectively, will have topped out (that is the first\ntwo columns with numbers added together). \nNotice the increase in bear market patterns topping out just over a month\nafter the breakout. Thus, if you see upward momentum soften then, consider\nselling. The softness may indicate a trend change.\nTable 14.6 shows size statistics. \nHeight.

In both bull and bear markets, patterns\nwith volume heavier on the left bottom than on the right performed better after\nthe breakout. \nTrading Tactics \nAs a bullish chart pattern, you need only know when to buy to trade AEDBs.\nSelling is, of course, the tough part. Before you buy, consider the trading tac-\ntics shown in Table 14.8.\nThe Measure rule. The measure rule predicts the minimum price move\nexpected once a double bottom experiences an upward breakout. Consider the\nchart pictured in Figure 14.6. To calculate the predicted price, first determine\nthe formation height by subtracting the lowest low from the highest high in the\nformation. In Figure 14.6, the lowest low occurs at the right bottom, with a\nprice of 27.57. The highest high, marked on the figure by point A, is 31.09.\nAdd the difference, 3.52, to the confirmation point, or the highest high\nbetween the two bottoms (that is, 31.09 + 3.52). Again, the highest high is\npoint A. The result, 34.61, is the expected minimum target. You can see in the\nchart that prices meet the target in late December. A few days after meeting\nthe target, prices momentarily descend before resuming their climb. During\nmid-April, the stock reaches its ultimate high price of 40.26 before declining.\nAfter you locate a potential double bottom, review the selection guide-\nlines before placing a trade. Figure 14.6 shows a declining price trend leading\nto the first bottom. The rise between the two bottoms is about 13%, just above\nthe 10% threshold. The two bottoms are at nearly the same price level and sev-\neral months apart.\n240\nDouble Bottoms, Adam & Eve\nTable 14.7\nVolume Statistics\nDescription\nBull Market\nBear Market\nRising volume trend performance\n33%\n31%a\nFalling volume trend performance\n39%\n33%\nU-shaped volume pattern performance\n35%\n35%\nDome-shaped volume pattern performance\n41%\n33%a\nNeither U-shaped nor dome-shaped volume pattern \n40%\n20%a\nperformance\nHeavy breakout volume performance\n36%\n33%\nLight breakout volume performance\n38%\n32%a\nHeavy left bottom volume performance\n39%\n34%\nHeavy right bottom volume performance\n32%\n26%a\naFewer than 30 samples.",

Until that time,\nshe shoehorns her investment activities into the few hours of free time she has\neach week.\nWhen she spotted the double bottom shown in Figure 14.6, she knew it\nwas love at first sight. The rounding bottom pattern (from point A to the break-\nout) suggested higher highs were in store. However, she resisted the temptation\nto get in early because she could not guarantee prices would continue moving\nup. She justified her action by pretending that she was teaching her students\nhow to trade. If she could not do it properly, how could they?\nWhen prices reached the high between the two bottoms, Lauren decided\nto buy. Just before she placed her order, the broker read off the current quota-\ntion. It was well above the confirmation point. So she decided to wait and pray\nfor a throwback.\nAbout 4 weeks after the breakout, prices dipped to the buy point, but\nwould they continue down? She had to wait until she felt confident that prices\nwould rise. To her, this occurred a day later, on November 27. That day prices\nmade a higher low and she felt comfortable buying the stock. It was a gamble,\nbecause 2 days of rising prices hardly make a trend. Still, she was getting antsy\nand did not want to wait too long and watch prices rise above the level that she\ncould have bought a month before.

Add this value to the breakout price (the confirmation\nline of 12.50) to get the target of 16. Prices climb to the target in mid-March.\nWait for breakout. I conducted a study and found that 64% of the time,\nprice did not close above confirmation before dropping below the right bottom\nlow. In other words, a double bottom fails 64% of the time if you do not wait\nfor confirmation. Confirmation and a breakout occurs when price closes above\nthe highest high between the two bottoms.

    "text": "Save yourself some money and avoid the stock. Look for a more promising chart\npattern in another industry.\nSample Trade\nFigure 15.6 shows a trade Willie made in the stock. He ran through Table 15.1\nand checked the identification characteristics against the pattern. Briefly, the\nstock price was trending down to the EADB. The Eve bottom caused him con-\ncern as the twin spikes were long but separated by a few days. Was that really\nan Adam bottom? The Adam bottom had a shorter spike. Was it an Eve bottom?\nHe looked above the spikes and saw that the Eve bottom was several weeks wide\nbut the Adam bottom remained narrow. He concluded that the pattern was an\nEADB. The rise between bottoms was over 10% and the bottoms looked to be\nabout 6 weeks apart. Volume was higher on the left bottom than the right,\nspelling good news for performance. \nAs he watched the pattern develop, he saw what looked like a head-and-\nshoulders bottom. He drew in the down-sloping neckline and when price closed\nabove it, confirming the head-and-shoulders bottom, he bought and received\na fill at 11. After that, it took just 2 days for price to confirm the EADB. \nWillie rode the stock higher and the price took on the shape of an ascend-\ning scallop—a rounded turn with a right handle. When the second, higher scal-\nlop appeared, he grew concerned. Sometimes, consecutive ascending scallops\nget narrower as they appear higher in the price trend. An unusually narrow one\nsometimes appears just before prices peak. So he decided to sell the stock as\nsoon as price dropped below the scallop bowl. That occurred in early May, and\nhe received a fill at 14.93, for a net gain of 35%—and that was in a bear market.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select EADBs that\nperform better after the breakout.

    "text": "The Eve & Eve double bottom is what many refer to as the classic “double bot-\ntom.” It sports two rounded bottoms, well separated with a rounding climb\nbetween them. That is the ideal pattern, but few look like that in the real\nworld. Of the four varieties of double bottoms, the Eve & Eve double bottom\n(EEDB) has the highest average rise—40%—in a bull market. Not only that,\nbut it has a low break-even failure rate: 4% What more could a trader want?\nTour\nWhat does an EEDB look like? Figure 16.1 shows a good example of the twin\nEve bottom. This EEDB forms after a broadening bottom chart pattern. The\ntwo Eve bottoms are wide, rounded, and distinct lows separated so that they are\nnot part of the same congestion region. The rise between the two bottoms in this\nexample measures an unusually large 40%. In March, price closes above the\nhighest high in the pattern, confirming the twin bottom as a true double bottom.\nWhy does a double bottom form? All chart patterns show the struggle\nbetween buying demand and selling pressure. When the price drops to a point\nwhere traders view the stock as a steal, they buy. If enough buy, the stock moves\nup in price. That is why the bottom usually shows a volume spike or high vol-\nume. In an EEDB, selling pressure balances buying demand, making the bottom\nturn long and gentle.\n260\nDouble Bottoms, Eve & Eve\nEve\nENSCO International (Oilfield Svcs/Equipment, NYSE, ESV)\nEve\nConfirmation Price\nThrowback\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n98\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan 99\nFigure 16.1\nA broadening bottom leads to an Eve & Eve double bottom.

    "text": "Prices rise and continue to rise until sellers, viewing the stock as over-\nbought, take profits. This selling pressure eventually stalls the upward move.\nWhen other traders see the upward momentum slowing, they dump their shares.\nThis selling forces the stock down again. \nWhen the price drops to a low enough level, the smart money accumulates\nshares again, sometimes quietly and sometimes not. Others see the slowing\ndownward price trend and predict a turn. They buy, too. \nAs price pulls out of its dive, more traders buy and the second Eve bottom\nforms as a gentle turn. Price begins climbing again. When it approaches the high\nbetween the two bottoms, it often stalls there as traders take profits. In a valid\nEEDB, the selling pressure does not send the price down again. Instead, traders\nsense the intrinsic strength and buy. This buying demand forces the price to tick\nupward, moving above the high between the two bottoms. That is the break-\nout signal. \nTechnical traders watching from the sidelines buy the stock in droves. Vol-\nume skyrockets along with the price. Reluctant sellers dump the stock to eager\nbuyers. The price climbs for several days and then things change. About half the\ntime, the price throws back to the breakout price. The throwback is brief before\nprice gathers strength and rises again, soaring to new highs. \nIdentification Guidelines\nI find that identifying EEDBs are easier than identifying birds, but, in both\ncases, you have to know what to look for. Not just any two bottoms at the same\nprice level will suffice for a double bottom. Listed in Table 16.1 are guidelines\nthat make correct selection easier. While considering the guidelines, look at\nFigure 16.2. \nDownward price trend. The stock begins declining in mid-October\n1993 from a price of about 56.50. It bottoms out at about 41.50 in mid-May.\nPrices never drop below the left low on the way to the bottom. The reason for\nthis guideline is that you should use the two lowest minor lows on the price\nchart. Do not try to select one low and then a nearby low just to satisfy the guide-\nlines. The two points marked A and B in Figure 16.2 represent an incorrectly\nselected double bottom because point A has lower lows to the left of it.\nBottom shape. Assign each double bottom pattern into its Adam or Eve\ncategory. Adam bottoms are narrow and V shaped, perhaps with a one- or two-\nday downward price spike. Eve bottoms are wide rounded turns. They may also\nhave price spikes, but they are usually shorter and more plentiful. \nRise between bottoms. The rise between the two bottoms should be at\nleast 10%, as measured from the lowest bottom low to the rise high.\nBottom low prices. The bottom to bottom price variation should be\nsmall. The basic rule is that two bottoms should appear to be near one another\non the price scale. Figure 16.2 shows a price variation of about 1%.\nIdentification Guidelines\n261",

    "text": "Bottom separation. The two bottoms should be at least a few weeks\napart but are often separated by many months, as shown in Figure 16.2. A\nmonth is the minimum separation that many professionals view as leading to\npowerful rallies. I set a lower standard to help verify that this is true. It turns\nout that peaks close together perform better than those spaced farther apart.\nPrice rise after right bottom. Prices should rise up to the confirmation\nprice without first making a third bottom. On average, it takes between 1 and\n2 months to complete the rise.\nBottom volume. The volume chart for double bottoms usually shows the\nhighest volume occurring on the left bottom. Diminished volume appears on the\nright bottom, and the volume trend of the overall formation is downward. None\nof these are absolute rules. Sometimes volume is highest on the right bottom in-\nstead of the left. However, on average most of the formations obey the guidelines.\nConfirmation price. The confirmation point is the highest high between\nthe two bottoms, and it is used to calculate the measure rule and to gauge the\nbreakout price (more about that later). Figure 16.2 shows a rise from the right\nbottom of 15%, above the 10% threshold.\nA double bottom is not a true double bottom until prices rise above the\nthe confirmation point. In tabulating the statistics, I only count those double bot-\ntom in which prices rise above the confirmation point. Why? Because of the high\nfailure rate: 64%. In one study, there were 980 formations that looked like dou-\nble bottoms, but their price trends eventually moved below the second bottom.\nAn additional 525 formations performed as expected by rising to the confir-\nmation point and continuing higher. If you buy a stock just after it touches the\nsecond bottom, your chances of having a successful trade are one in three. In\nother words, wait for prices to rise above the confirmation point.\nNow that you know what a double bottom looks like, let us discuss how\nto separate it into its proper Adam and Eve category. Figure 16.3 shows another\nexample of an EEDB but one harder to identify. Both bottoms have a one-day\ndownward spike. However, as you look up the bottom, prices widen. If you were\nto shave off that one day’s growth, you would have a rounding turn on both\nbottoms. Adam bottoms are narrower and usually longer. \nA good example of an Adam bottom occurs in December when prices\nplunge downward for three days. The bottom looks narrow and pointed, not\nwide and rounded. Notice the different appearance between the Adam and Eve\nbottoms. When trying to determine whether the double bottom has Adam or\nEve components, ask yourself if the two bottoms look similar (Adam & Adam\nor Eve & Eve) or different (Adam & Eve or Eve & Adam). If they look the same,\nare the bottoms wide or narrow, pointed or rounded? \nLet us look at another example, Figure 16.4. The first Eve bottom is nar-\nrower than the second one and it looks like a widely spaced horn (it has two\nminor lows). The right bottom looks wide but it is V shaped. Are these Adam\nbottoms?\nIdentification Guidelines\n263",

    "text": "Before the April to August price bump, prices were in a long-term decline.\nThere was a block of horizontal price movement at 17.50 that was 3 months long\n(not shown) if you include some minor lows. Thus, the reason the Eve & Eve\npattern failed to rise was overhead resistance coupled with a deteriorating fun-\ndamental picture.\nI like to know what is going on in the stocks I follow. I keep a database of\nevents and can match an event to the price action. The company released earn-\nings on both sides of the April/August price bump. The first release helped\npower prices up and the second helped take them down. During creation of the\nEve bottom, news appeared that machine tool orders were soft (down 2%)\nmonth-to-month and down 30% from the prior year. Coupled with increased\nforeign competition and insider selling, the fundamentals were going south.\nThat information did not help the technical picture. \nThe bump in price from April to the August Eve bottom reminds me of\nwhat sometimes happens to diamond tops. The price shoots up in a few days,\nforms a diamond top, and then tumbles back to where it started. From there, the\nstock flatlines as if it has lost its will to live. I would not consider trading this\ndouble bottom because that scenario looks similar to this one.\nStatistics\nTable 16.2 shows general statistics for EEDBs.\nNumber of formations.

    "text": "Later I discuss the measure rule, but suppose it predicts a target that is\n20% higher than the breakout price. How many EEDBs in a bear market will\nmake that kind of a rise? Answer: 59% (41% will fail to rise at least 20%). If a\n41% failure rate sounds too high, then you should move the price target closer\nto the breakout.\nTable 16.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\nFormation end to breakout. Measured from the left bottom low to the\nbreakout, it took price between a month (39 days, bull market) and 2 months\n(57 days, bear market) to travel that distance. It makes sense that in a bear mar-\nket it would take longer because price struggles to move higher. After the break-\nout, though, prices in a bear market rise faster (see “Days to ultimate high” in\nTable 16.2).\nYearly position. Nearly half the time in a bull market, the breakout\noccurs in the middle of the yearly price range. In a bear market, the results\nsplit almost evenly.\nYearly position, performance. Where are the best performing EEDBs\nlocated? In both bull and bear markets, EEDBs breaking out within a third of\nthe yearly low perform best. The worst showing is from EEDBs in the middle\nof the yearly range, and, guess what, that is where many EEDBs reside.\nThrowbacks. Throwbacks only occur about half the time. They give\ninvestors another opportunity to take a position in a stock or to add to an exist-\ning position. When price does throw back, it takes 11 days from the breakout to\nreturn to the breakout price. That suggests prices peak in less than a week then\ntake a few more days to retrace their gains. Keep that in mind if you decide to\nbuy at the confirmation price and sell before a throwback begins.\n268\nDouble Bottoms, Eve & Eve\nTable 16.4\nBreakout and Postbreakout Statistics\nDescription\nBull Market\nBear Market\nFormation end to breakout\n39 days\n57 days\nPercentage of breakouts occurring near the\nL32%, C41%, \nL32%, C35%, \n12-month low (L), center (C), or high (H) \nH27%\nH32%\nPercentage rise for each 12-month lookback\nL45%, C38%, \nL30%a, C19%a, \nperiod\nH40%\nH26%a\nThrowbacks\n55%\n46%\nAverage time to throwback ends\n11 days\n11 days\nAverage rise for patterns with throwback\n33%\n24%\nAverage rise for patterns without throwback\n48%\n25%\nPerformance with breakout day gap\n42%\n21%a\nPerformance without breakout day gap\n40%\n26%\nAverage gap size\n$0.47\n$1.78\naFewer than 30 samples.",

    "text": "When a throwback occurs, performance suffers. In a bull market, for exam-\nple, the rise is 33% when a throwback occurs, and 48% without a throwback.\nThis finding suggests you should look for overhead resistance and avoid any\nsituations that might cause price to be repelled.\nGaps. Breakout day gaps marginally help performance in a bull market\nbut hurt it in a bear market. Notice that the gap size in a bear market is almost\nfour times the average size of gaps in a bull market. This finding suggests you\nplace a buy order slightly below the breakout price so that it, hopefully, will get\nyou in before the actual breakout.\nTable 16.5 shows a frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high. Few\npatterns fail (top out) in the first week, but look at the bear market row, columns\n35 and 42 days. In those 2 weeks, 20% of the EEDBs in a bear market reach the\nultimate high. Thus, you should expect price to peak in just over a month after\nthe breakout. Bull markets show weakness in weeks 3 and 4 (days 21 and 28 in\nthe table). For some reason, this weakness occurs regularly in bear market chart\npatterns (of all types). \nTable 16.6 shows statistics related to size. \nHeight. The bull market results surprise me because tall patterns usually\nperform better than short ones. That is still true in a bear market, but the differ-\nence is minimal. In a bull market, patterns shorter than the median perform bet-\nter after the breakout, with gains averaging 41% versus 39%.\nTo use this result, measure the EEDB height from the highest high\nbetween the two bottoms to the lowest low in the pattern and then divide by\nthe highest high (the breakout price). If the result is smaller than the median\nlisted in Table 16.6, then you have a short pattern.\nWidth. I measured the pattern width from lowest low in the left bottom\nto the right bottom low. Those patterns narrower than the median performed\nsubstantially better than wider ones. \nAverage formation length. The average formation length from left bot-\ntom low to the right was between 2 and 3 months (73 to 80 days).\nHeight and width combinations. EEDBs that are both short and narrow\nin a bull market or tall and narrow in a bear market tend to do best. The worst\nperformance comes from patterns that are both short and wide. All of the bear\nmarket results use few samples, so the numbers may change.\nBottom price variation. Do EEDBs with small price variations in their\nbottom lows perform better than do those with large variations? Yes and no.\nStatistics\n269\nTable 16.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market \n8%\n12%\n9%\n3%\n12%\n8%\n3%\n3%\n5%\n0%\n36%\nBull market\n14%\n5%\n6%\n6%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n4%\n3%\n51%",

Use the measure rule to predict a target price. Having a\ntarget to aim at may allow you to get out near the peak. If price nears the target,\nevaluate the situation. Will price continue moving higher or is there a larger like-\nlihood of a drop?\nTo find the price target, compute the height of the pattern by subtract-\ning the lowest low in the bottom from the highest high between the two bot-\ntoms. Add the result to the highest high to get the price target. For example,\nFigure 16.6 shows an EEDB. The lowest low in the pattern is the left bottom\nat 14.27. The highest high is 18.39 (the breakout or confirmation price). Add\nthe difference, 4.12, to the highest high to get a target of 22.51. In this exam-\nple, price rose to only 20 before dropping. \nYou can use Table 16.3 to check your target. In this example, a move of\n4.12 from the launch point of 18.39 means a 22% rise.

Figure 15.6 in the prior chapter shows an example of this\nsituation. Buy when price moves above the congestion and put a stop on the far\nside of the support area (that is, below the shelf).\nTrade with market trend. Let the smart money trade against the pre-\nvailing trend. You should follow in their footsteps once they have cleared a\npath through the landmines. In other words, trade with the general market\ntrend. Buy bullish chart patterns (like EEDBs) in a rising stock market. Avoid\nthem in a bear market.\nCheck others in the industry. If other stocks in the same industry are\ndoing well, then that bolsters the case that your EEDB will break out upward,\nreversing the downward price trend. If other stocks in the industry are show-\ning bullish bottoming patterns or if their stock prices are rising, then trade the\nEEDB. If prices in other stocks are breaking down, making lower lows, then look\nelsewhere for a more promising situation. Double bottoms are plentiful. Keep\nsearching.\nSample Trade\nNot all chart pattern trades work as expected, and Figure 16.6 shows an exam-\nple. To be sure we are dealing with a valid EEDB, let us run through the iden-\ntification characteristics. Is the price trending downward to the pattern? Yes.\nAlthough the figure shows a high in mid-January (B), the stock crested back in\nmid-November 1999 (not shown).\nDo both bottoms resemble an Eve bottom? The shape appears rounded\nin both bottoms. The left bottom comprises two minor lows, but if you exclude\nthe first minor low (shown as point A), the Eve assessment does not change.\nThe rise between the bottoms is 29%, and the bottoms are 4% apart in\nprice and 18 days distant (measured from lowest low to lowest low). This is one\nof the narrower Eve bottoms, but it is still in the 2 to 7–week optimum range.\nVolume is higher on the right bottom than the left in a bear market. This obser-\nvation suggests slightly better postbreakout performance, but does not guaran-\ntee it. Price rises up to the confirmation price without first dropping below the\nright bottom low. The pattern is a valid EEDB.\nWhat happened after the breakout? Prices climbed enough to clear the\nconfirmation line then threw back and continued down. The stock reached a low\nof 4.24, recovered, and then dropped more, bottoming at 2.02 in February 2003.\nIf you bought at the breakout price and sold at the highest high, you would have\nmade 9%, without deducting commissions or other trading costs. Average\ntraders would have lost money, perhaps a lot of it if they rode the stock down.\nSample Trade\n273",

    "text": "What went wrong? Is this another case of overhead resistance? No. This\nis a case where the fundamentals take center stage. See that large gap on the left\nof the chart? Ten days before the gap, a brokerage downgraded the stock. The\nstock dropped, sure, but it hardly noticed the downgrade.\nOn November 29, when the market was closed, the company announced\nthat it would not meet its previous sales projections. When the stock opened the\nfollowing day, price gapped lower, closing 36% below the prior close. In short,\nthe stock dead-cat bounced; the bounce phase was the rounding turn before the\nEEDB (point B).\nA brokerage firm rated the stock “outperform” on the day it gapped lower.\nSuch positive statements after a large down gap help drive the price higher in\nthe bounce phase. However, the dire situation eventually catches the hype and\nthe stock sinks . . . sometimes dramatically, like that shown here.\nThus, even though we had a valid EEDB, the fundamentals were scream-\ning sell. I do not recommend taking a position in a stock showing a dead-cat\nbounce for at least 6 months, sometimes even up to a year. Many chart patterns\nduring that time look promising but fail to perform as expected. This is one\nexample.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select EEDBs that\nperform better after the breakout. Consult the associated table for more\ninformation.\n• Review the identification characteristics for correct selection—\nTable 16.1.\n• Trade EEDBs in a bull market—Table 16.2.\n• EEDBs show lower failure rates in bull markets than in bear ones—\nTable 16.3.\n• Select patterns with breakouts near the yearly low—Table 16.4.\n• Throwbacks hurt performance. Avoid EEDBs showing nearby over-\nhead resistance—Table 16.4.\n• Watch for the rise to stall 5 to 6 weeks after the breakout in a bear\nmarket—Table 16.5.\n• Choose narrow patterns—Table 16.6.\n• Pick patterns with a lower right bottom—Table 16.6.\n• Select patterns with volume heavier on the right bottom than the left—\nTable 16.7.\n274\nDouble Bottoms, Eve & Eve",

That qualification is important as an earlier study I did found\nthat price continues rising 65% of the time without confirming the twin-peak\npattern.

See how it appears\nrounded and wide? \nThe AADT confirms as a valid double top when price closes below the\nconfirmation line. The confirmation line is the lowest low between the two\npeaks. Adam & Adam peaks A and B are not part of a double top because price\ndoes not confirm the pattern. Instead, prices rise above the higher of the two\npeaks, invalidating the double top pattern.\nFigure 17.3 shows another example of an AADT and an Eve top. The Eve\ntop is wide and composed of several short spikes—minor highs—and the group\nappears rounded. Adam tops are narrow, inverted V’s, usually composed of\none- or two-day price spikes. Prices climb into the pattern, form the tops, and\ndrop to the confirmation line, validating the AADT. In this example, volume\ntrends upward and that is unusual. Volume is also heavier on the right top if\nyou bracket the peak with 5 days of average volume (2 days to the left to 2 days\nto the right). Volume is usually heavier on the left peak.\nTable 17. 1 shows identification characteristics for AADTs.

    "text": "Upward price trend. Prices must trend upward leading to the pattern to\nqualify it as a top, not a bottom. The upward price trend can be short, though. \nTop shape. The Adam top should appear as an inverted V, narrow, and\nmany times made of a one- or two-day price spike. Eve tops appear wider and\nmore rounded as the November turn shows in Figure 17.4. Eve tops usually\nhave price spikes that are shorter and more congested.\nValley between tops. A dip should separate the two tops, making each\ntop stand out as its own minor high. Do not select patterns that are part of the\nsame congestion pattern. For this reason, the peaks marked A and B in Figure\n17.4 are not part of a double top. \nTop high prices. The price difference between the two peaks is usually\nminimal, between 0% and 6%. The key is that they should appear to be at or\nnear the same price. The two tops shown in Figure 17.4, for example, have a 4%\nprice variation. \nTop separation. How far apart should the peaks be? Some analysts argue\nthat a month is the minimum, but I put no such limitation on the patterns I\nselected. However, be sure that the tops are distinct minor highs. The best per-\nforming AADTs had tops 5 to 7 weeks apart. Those wider than 8 weeks showed\nperformance that deteriorated, but the sample size is small. Thus, do not let\nwidely spaced peaks sway your opinion.\nPrice decline after right top. Price must decline to the confirmation\nprice before you consider taking a position, unless the situation warrants a\nquicker move. Sometimes, instead of confirming, the stock forms another peak,\nforming a triple top. If that happens, treat the pattern as a triple top.\nTop volume. Volume is usually higher on the left peak than on the right.\nLinear regression on the volume from peak to peak says it trends lower.\nConfirmation price. Wait for price to close below the confirmation line\nbefore trading a stock showing a double top. The reason for this delay is that\n65% of the time, price will not drop to the confirmation line before making a\nnew high. Only after price confirms the pattern does a twin-peak pattern become\na true double top.\nFocus on Failures\nDouble tops have two types of failures. The first is one of identification. You\nmust wait for price to close below the confirmation line. Only then does the\ntwin-peak pattern become a true double top. You can try trading the pattern\nbefore price drops to the confirmation line, but if you are shorting a stock, you\nwill probably take a loss when the price soars away from you. Do the smart thing\nand wait for price to close below the low between the two peaks before trading.\nThe second type of failure is what I call a 5% failure. That means price con-\nfirms the pattern and then drops less than 5% below the breakout price before\nrebounding. It does not happen often (8% in a bull market and 11% in a bear\nmarket), but the chance is not zero. Be prepared and use a stop to limit the loss.\n280\nDouble Tops, Adam & Adam",

Sometimes it may be wise to ride out the decline. \nSay you bought the stock at the February low, 19.25. At the first Adam\ntop (35), you made 82%—nearly a double. Watching the stock drop to the\nconfirmation line must have been painful. That drop took price down to 24.88,\na decline that reduced your profit to just 29%. \nLook what would have happened if you sold the stock the day after price\nclosed below the sell trend line: That would have gotten you out at 29.94 for a\nprofit of 56%.\nI recently sold a utility stock because it shot up like the rise to point A in\nFigure 17.6.

I will miss the 5.3% yield at a time when money\nmarket funds are paying just 0.3%. The price has declined since I sold it.\nPoints A and B are called spikes or tails. Point A is especially good because\nthe price closes near the daily low. That is important. Look for a long price spike\nwith a close near the daily low. For the first Adam peak, if you sold the day after\nthe spike, you would have made 62%. If you sold at the close the day after points\nB and A, you would have made 55% and 40%, respectively. Those are good\ngains regardless of how you slice it. \nMost amateur investors would have held onto the stock and rode it back\ndown. As it bottomed at the confirmation line, they may have sold (some did\nas the slight rise in volume suggests). Others held on, vowing to sell if price\nreached the old high. When price climbed and approached the old high, their\ntune changed. Their desire to sell melted into greed. “Why sell if the stock is\ngoing up?”\nGood point. But you have to sell sometime. Price fluctuations may shake\namateurs out or they may turn stubborn and hold on, this time riding the stock\ndown to the confirmation point. That is when the twin peaks turn into a valid\ndouble top. That is also the time to sell. Placing a stop-loss order at the con-\nfirmation line means your position sells without your having to worry about it. \nIn this example, a second sell trend line would work well when price closed\nbelow it in September. If you sold at the close the following day, you would have\nmade 50%. That is much better than the 29% gain when selling at the confir-\nmation line. \nAm I advocating selling before confirmation? No. Every time I have done\nthat in a double top, the stock never confirmed, and I gave up profit because\nprice made new highs. Still, you can increase your profit by taking shortcuts to\nselling as the example shows (using trend lines, for instance). You can always\nbuy back in if price does not sink to the confirmation point.\nThe choice is yours. If you are just days away from changing a short-term\ngain into a long-term one, it may be wise to hold off selling. I did something\nsimilar by waiting 3 days to push a trade into a new tax year, shifting income.\nBy delaying, I changed a 40% profit into a 27% one.

    "text": "Adam & Eve double bottoms (AEDTs) perform about average (bull market) or\nslightly below (bear market) when compared to the average decline of other\nbearish chart pattern types. The double-digit break-even failure rate in a bull\nmarket is high, too. Thus, trade this one from the short side in a bear market for\nthe best performance. If you own the stock in a bull market and it double tops,\nyou might want to sell or not, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes it\nmay pay to weather a small decline after an AEDT, especially if the general\nmarket and others in the industry are soaring.\nAEDTs have a few surprises, and I discuss them in the Statistics section.\nTour\nAlong with the head-and-shoulders formation, double tops are perhaps the most\npopular. Many novice investors see a dual peak on the stock chart and proclaim\nit to be a double top. It probably is not. There are a number of characteristics\nthat compose a true double top and I discuss them in a moment, but, first, what\ndoes a double top look like?\nConsider Figure 18.1, a double top in ElkCorp. The first thing one notices\nare the twin peaks. They should be near the same price level and widely spaced.\nThe price trend leading to the first peak is upward and prices fall away after the\nsecond peak.\nThe intervening valley is just that: a valley that sees prices decline by 10%\nto 20%, sometimes more. The valley floor forms the confirmation level or point.\nA twin peak formation becomes a true double top once price closes below the\nconfirmation point, signaling a breakout. \nSometimes a pullback occurs such as that shown in Figure 18.1. A pullback\nallows investors another opportunity to exit their position before the decline\nresumes. For more aggressive traders, the pullback is a chance to make a short\nsale in the hope that prices will continue falling. \nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 18.1 lists identification characteristics that Adam & Eve double tops share.\nThey are only guidelines—not rules—and exceptions are many.\nUpward price trend. Figure 18.2 shows an AEDT that forms after a\nshort-term price rise beginning in November. The average rise leading to\nAEDTs is 128 days, or about 4 months long.\nTop shape. When searching for an Adam & Eve double top, remember\nthat the Adam peak should look different from Eve. Adam looks like an inverted\nV, usually with a one- or two-day price spike poking out of the top. Eve is\nrounder and wider. Adam peaks come first; Eve, second. The shape difference\nis clear in the figures accompanying this chapter.\n292\nDouble Tops, Adam & Eve",

The result is the target, the minimum price move expected.\nUnfortunately, this method only works 69% of the time, far short of the 80%\nI like to see. \nFor example, look at Figure 18.6. The highest high in the Adam & Eve\ndouble top is at 28.72, on the Eve top, and the lowest low (the confirmation line)\nis at 25.78. Divide the difference (2.94) by 2 (1.47) and subtract the result from\nthe lowest low to get a target of 24.31. Price reached the target at point A.\nWait for breakout. As a trading signal, you will want to wait for the break-\nout before exiting a long position or opening a short one. The breakout price\nis the lowest low between the two tops, shown in Figure 18.6 as the confirma-\ntion line.

    "text": "The first thing to notice is that this double top occurs in a bull market. That\nsuggests a smaller decline than if it were in a bear market. The S&P 500 index\nhad just reached a new high on October 7, but was easing lower on the break-\nout day (October 16). The five stocks in the apparel industry that I follow all\nmade highs in October 1997 and by the confirmation date, were trending down-\nward. That was a good indication that the stock should be sold.\nThe Eve peak sets the yearly high, and Table 18.4 says that the worst per-\nformance comes from breakouts within a third of the yearly high. That obser-\nvation sounds a note of caution.\nThe support line set up by the ascending triangle in June suggested that\nprice would have a difficult time piercing it. Thus, expect a pullback. Table\n18.4 shows that a pullback hurts performance, but the difference in a bull mar-\nket is small.\nIs the pattern a tall one? The height as a percentage of the breakout price\nmeasures 11.4%. This is less than the median, so the pattern is short, suggest-\ning substantial underperformance.\nIs the pattern narrow? Yes. The pattern is 16 days wide (as measured\nbetween the highest high in each top). Narrow patterns marginally outperform\nin a bull market.\nWhich peak is lower? The Adam peak is lower than Eve, and Table 18.6\nsays that in a bull market, AEDTs with lower left tops underperform, but the\ndifference is not significant.\nWhat about volume? Figure 18.6 shows U-shaped volume between the\npeaks and that is good news according to Table 18.7. Patterns with U-shaped\nvolume perform significantly better that those with other shapes. Is the break-\nout volume heavy or light? I highlight the breakout volume the day after the\nbreakout, just so you can find the breakout day easily. The preceding day, the\nbreakout day, volume is light. Table 18.7 loves light breakout volume as pat-\nterns with that condition perform substantially better. Finally, which top has\nheavier volume? According to my spreadsheet, it is the right top. I used 5 days\nof volume surrounding each peak and compared the two. Table 18.7 says to\nexpect underperformance with the heavy right top volume scenario.\nThus, this analysis showed mixed technical evidence. If you owned the\nstock, you could sell on the breakout. Waiting for a pullback before selling is\ndangerous because they occur just 59% of the time, but with underlying support\nby the ascending triangle, a pullback was a good bet. \nIf you wanted to short this stock, the timing is the same. Short at the break-\nout and add to your position when price turns downward after the pullback\ncompletes, or just short when price drops again after the pullback.\nSay you short the stock at the breakout. Price pulls back then drops to\npoint A. Since that is a new minor low, place the stop a dime or so above the\ntop of the pullback, the closest minor high. Price climbs to B then drops to C.\nC is lower than A, so it is a new minor low. Lower the stop to B. Price climbs\nto D then drops to E. Move the stop to D.

Since the breakout happens on October 16, take the dif-\nference between the high and low over the prior month and find the average\ndifference. In this case, it is 0.71. That represents the average price swing each\nday from mid-September to mid-October. Multiply it by 1.5, giving a result of\n1.07. Place the stop no closer (lower) than 1.07 above the current close. With the\nclose at E being 21.94, place the stop no closer than 23. If you used this approach\non the B to C leg, the stop would have taken you out at 24.14, but that is 6%\nbelow the breakout price. \nKeep moving the stop lower as prices drop. A new low on the way to H\nmeans the stop is lowered to F. That is 17% away from the low at H (measured\nfrom high to low), but with this volatile stock, I would tighten the stop using the\nvolatility rule and because the price is going nearly vertical.\nHow do you sell? If the stock rises, the stop will take you out automatically.\nAnother way is to see the head-and-shoulders bottom forming at GHK. A neck-\nline drawn from F to J and extended to the right marks the breakout price. Cover\nyour short at the open the day after price closes above the neckline. \nIf you traded this stock, you would have made about 16%. That is close\nto the average decline of 18% in a bull market (see Table 18.2), but the aver-\nage uses the ultimate low at H for a 27% drop. Notice that the climb from C (day\n27) to D occurs 1 month after the breakout, just as the discussion of Table 18.5\nwarned.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help you select better per-\nforming AEDTs. Refer to the associated table for more information. \n• Correctly identify the pattern using the guidelines—Table 18.1.\n• This pattern performs best in a bear market or when the general mar-\nket is declining—Table 18.2.\n• Patterns in a bear market have lower failure rates—Table 18.3.\n• Avoid pullbacks because performance suffers. Look for nearby under-\nlying support before trading—Table 18.4.\n• In bull markets, watch for a rise a month after the breakout. In a bear\nmarket, look for a rise around days 14 to 21—Table 18.5.\n• Tall patterns perform better than short ones—Table 18.6.\n• Select patterns that are both tall and narrow—Table 18.6.\n• Patterns with a lower right top outperform—Table 18.6.\n• Select patterns with U-shaped volume—Table 18.7.\n306\nDouble Tops, Adam & Eve",

However, performance\nsuffers for widely spaced peaks. The thinking here is that it is easier for traders\nto see twin peaks a month apart than a year apart.

How many EADTs will decline at least that\nfar in a bull market? Answer: 32% (68% will fail to decline at least 20%).

The answer is unclear because the numbers are too close or have\nlow sample counts. However, many bearish patterns do best when the breakout\nis near the yearly low.\nPullbacks. EADTs in a bull market have one of the higher pullback rates.\nAlmost two out of three pull back and take between 10 and 11 days for prices\nto return to the confirmation line (the breakout). When prices do pull back, the\nupward retrace breaks downward momentum and performance suffers. \nBefore trading, look for underlying support. If a support zone is nearby,\nthen bet on a pullback. If you anticipate a pullback and are a swing trader, short\nthe stock on the breakout and close out your position in a few days or a week\nwhen prices bottom before the pullback begins. Enter another trade when the\npullback completes and prices start dropping again.\nGaps. Gaps hurt performance, as Table 19.4 shows.

It\nreminds me of a measured move down chart pattern.\nDoes the pattern obey the guidelines listed in Table 19.1? The brief rise\nshown by line A satisfies the upward price trend leading to the EADT. The twin-\npeak pattern shows a rounded Eve top paired with a pointed Adam top. The\nvalley between the tops measures 9%—a bit on the short side. The two tops have\nprices that vary by just 1% and are 25 days apart. Price drops to the confirma-\ntion line without making a third peak. Volume is heavier on the left peak than\nthe right, which is unusual. Thus, the pattern meets the identification guidelines:\nit is an Eve & Adam double top.\nWhat is so special about this EADT? Two things. First, the U-shaped vol-\nume pattern is exquisite. Second, notice the quick rise leading to the pattern,\nhighlighted by line A. Price rockets upward for a week then moves sideways in\nthe pattern. Nearly as steep is the decline out of the pattern, shown by line \nB. If I were trading this double top, I would place an order to sell shares at \nthe confirmation line. That way, I would get in at a good price as the pattern\nconfirmed. \nI would expect a pullback because of the July congestion. Worst case, I\nwould put a stop at the Adam top, just in case things got out of control. For the\ndownward target, the measure rule predicts a decline to 30.10, as I discussed in\nthe “Measure rule” in Table 19.8. Since I know that a quick decline often fol-\nlows a quick rise, I would set the target lower, at the beginning of the quick\nrise, or about 27.78. Since that is below the round number 28, I would proba-\nbly target 28.07 or some oddball number. Everyone is going to try buying at 28,\nand I want to get my price before the others drive it back up. \nIn fact, you can see that price stalled at 28 for 3 days before resuming the\ntumble (point D in Figure 19.4). If, by some magic, I stayed in the trade, I would\nexpect a further decline to the down-sloping trend line. A rising volume trend\nas price declined is a good sign of a strong down move. \nThe quick rise after C suggests you need to be on top of this stock, follow-\ning it closely to time the exit if you do not use a stop order. Delays are costly.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help you select better per-\nforming EADTs. Refer to the associated table for more information. \n• Correctly identify the pattern using the guidelines—Table 19.1.\n• Trade this pattern in a bear market—Table 19.2.\n• If you can tell when price has reached the ultimate low or if the patterns\nbusts, buy—Table 19.2.\nFor Best Performance\n319",

    "text": "When traders say, “double top,” they are referring to an Eve & Eve double top\n(EEDT). This is the classic pattern for a reason: It performs well. In a bear\nmarket, the break-even failure rate is just 2% and prices decline 25% after the\nbreakout, on average. That is superb performance. Even in a bull market, the\npattern shows its stuff. After reaching the ultimate low, price soars 63%, on\naverage. Busted patterns in a bull market do even better: a 70% rise.\nThe pattern has many surprises we have heard before plus a new one.\nWhen volume is heavier on the left top than on the right, the pattern tends to\noutperform. I discuss these surprises in the Statistics section.\nTour\nFigure 20.1 shows what an Eve & Eve double top looks like. It reminds me of a\nperson with large eyebrows, the confirmation line is the nose, and the mouth\nis the U-shaped volume trend. The double top forms after an upward price\ntrend and has a rounding turn between the two highs. The rounding turn is not\na prerequisite, and I have not studied the performance of double top shapes in\nthat regard.\nThe twin peaks look similar in that both have wide bases and a gentle price\nturn at each top.

Consider Figure 20.4, a common failure of a double top. The\ntwin peaks satisfy all the identification guidelines outlined in Table 20.1 with\ntwo exceptions. First, the volume pattern is suspect. Volume on formation of the\nleft top is high but lasts only 1 day. The right top volume is dense, high, and\nremains high for about a week as the top forms. However, in defense of the for-\nmation, the volume pattern often varies from the norm and offers little clue to\nthe eventual outcome. \nThe second guideline violated is the more important of the two: Prices fail\nto close below the confirmation point. When considering all twin peak chart\npatterns in this study, two out of three (65%) perform as the one shown in Fig-\nure 20.4.

Even if you are late\ncalling the turn, you can still make a profit. Consider the Eve & Eve double top\nshown in the figure. \nBefore you trade this stock, ask yourself if it is an EEDT. Running through\nthe identification guidelines shown in Table 20.1, we find that the price rise\nleading to the pattern begins at A (far left, bottom). Both peaks look similar in\nthat they are wide and made of several short spikes—all characteristic of Eve\ntops. The left peak is more pointed but wider than the right one.\nThe valley dips 14% and the peaks top out at about the same price. The\npeak-to-peak separation measures 55 days or almost 2 months. Volume is heav-\nier on the right peak than the left. Finally, the decline to the confirmation line\nis a straight-line run; price does not form a third peak. In short, this is a valid\nEEDT when price closes below the confirmation line.\nHow do you trade it? For this trade, imagine that you do not own the\nstock nor do you want to sell it short. The S&P 500 index reached a low in\nOctober 2002 and bounced, forming a higher low in early March, right when\nprice was bottoming at B.

    "text": "What was clear after the March bottom is that everything started moving up in\ntandem. The industry started recovering, as did the general market (a new bull\nrun). A buy signal occurred when price closed above the down-sloping trend\nline. The high volume at B (a common bottom phenomenon) also suggested a\nbottom—panic selling. \nAdditional evidence of a major turn comes from points A and B. Point A\nmarks a major turning point for the stock; B, being a higher low, is a retest of\nthat low. Since it did not drop below A, it is a bullish signal.\nIf you missed the trend-line signal and higher low at B, then a close above\nthe double top would be another buy signal. With a 63% average rise, you have\nplenty of time to buy. If you bought at the B low, you would have made 73%.\nBuying at the EEDT high would have made a profit of 36%. The stock topped\nout at 44.13, by the way, before tumbling back to 32, near the double top high.\nNot all trades will work out as well as this one. A major bull run began\nafter the October low and the industry responded with large gains. Both helped\npropel the stock higher. A combination of bullish factors is often what sepa-\nrates a winning trade from a losing one.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help you select better per-\nforming EEDTs.

The quick price move starts at point A\nand finishes at B. In these two examples, the move after the flag is longer than\nthe one before the flag, but that is not always the case. The move after the flag\ncompletes is a key trait of this pattern. By using the length of the trend leading\nto the pattern, you can gauge how far prices will move after the breakout.\nTable 21.1 outlines the identification characteristics for flags.\nPrices bounded by two trend lines.

Prices move against the short-term trend for several days\nbefore continuing on.\nFocus on Failures\nLike all formations, flags are not immune to failure. Figure 21.4 shows a flag fail-\nure. The flag, while obeying the confines of the two down-sloping trend lines,\nhas a good volume trend. Prices should continue higher after the flag completes\nbut do not. Why? One explanation is that the formation is just too long at 26\ndays. Sometimes an excessively long formation suggests an impending failure or\na weak price move (after the breakout). Trade flags more than 3 weeks long care-\nfully or pass them up entirely. In this example, the flag is not proportional to the\nup move preceding it, suggesting the need for caution trading it.\nFigure 21.5 shows a more common failure, one of performance. The\ndecline in the February flag begins at A, 43, and ends at B, 38.90, for a run of\n4.10. The decline from C to D measures 3.06. If flags were true half-staff pat-\nterns, the two runs would be about equal. Since this is but one example, the\nResults Snapshot shows that more than half the flags hit their price targets.\nIn this example, the flag has to chew through trend-line support just beneath\nthe flag. The dip is brief, as sometimes happens in trend-line pierces, and price\nrecovers only to surge upward, eventually making a new high.

Where do flags occur most often? The answer varies\nacross market conditions and breakout directions. For example, flags with\ndownward breakouts have the breakout near the yearly low, but flags in bull\nmarkets with up breakouts have breakouts that appear near the yearly high.\nYearly position, performance. Flags show no consistent performance\ntrend as far as position in the yearly price range. For example, flags in a bull\nmarket with upward breakouts do best when the breakout is within a third of\nthe yearly high. Downward breakouts do best near the yearly low (bull market)\nor middle (bear market).\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks (up breakouts) and pullbacks\n(down breakouts) occur less than half the time. During a throwback or pull-\nback, it takes price between 12 and 15 days to return to the breakout price.\nWhen a throwback or pullback happens, performance suffers. For example,\nflags having throwbacks in a bull market rise 13% after the breakout. When a\nthrowback does not happen, the rise averages 31%.\nTo avoid a throwback or pullback, look for nearby overhead resistance or\nunderlying support. Choose flags with resistance or support farther away or\nnonexistent.\nGaps. I found only 86 gaps, split evenly between up and down gaps. In all\ncases, when a gap does not occur, performance improves, but that may be due\nto the low sample count for those patterns with gaps. Thus, I reserve judgment.\nThe average gap size varies from 15 to 41 cents.\nTable 21.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the trend high or low.\nAs you can see, most patterns reach the end of the trend quickly. In 2 weeks’\ntime, between 56% and 58% will have ended their run. Within a month,\nbetween 80% and 88% of the flags will have reached the trend high or low.\nThus, be prepared to take profits quickly.

Patterns in bear markets with downward breakouts did better with\nbreakout volume heavier than the average.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 21.8 shows trading tactics for flags. Consult Figure 21.6 as I review the\ntactics listed in Table 21.8.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule gauges the minimum price move. First,\ndetermine where the trend begins, which is usually the minor high (for down-\ntrends) or low (for uptrends) preceding the formation. Figure 21.6 shows the\ntrend beginning at point A. Subtract the low at the formation start (point B at\n42.75) from point A (47.50), giving a difference of 4.75. Subtract the difference\nfrom the high at the formation end (point C at 43) to give the target price of\n38.25. Prices reach the target 13 trading days after they move below the for-\nmation trend line.\nWhen trading flags, you must first be sure you have a valid formation.\nUse the identification guidelines outlined in Table 21.1 to ensure that you\nhave correctly identified a flag.\nUse the measure rule to gauge the amount of profit likely from the trade\nand weigh the amount of profit against the possible risk of failure. Look for\nsupport and resistance levels where price trends were repulsed in the past.\nMany times prices will pause or turn around at these junctions. These values\nbecome the risk points for a trade. You can compare the risk with the reward\nby computing the current price with the measure rule target and the first or\nsecond level of support or resistance.\nFor the stock shown in Figure 21.6, the potential reward is 4.75 (that is,\n43–38.25). The first resistance level is at 44 and there is another at 45 (assum-\ning the trade goes against you and prices rise). The risk is one or two, that \nis, 44–43 or 45–43. The ratio, at 4.75 to 1, suggests this formation is worth\nTrading Tactics\n347\nTable 21.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nCalculate the price difference between the start of the trend and\nthe formation.

    "text": "the trader the opportunity to buy the stock before the rise resumes. How do\nyou correctly identify a high, tight flag?\nIdentification Guidelines\nThe phrase, high, tight flag, is a misnomer as the formation usually does not\nresemble a flag formation at all. Sometimes prices move up slightly as the flag\nprogresses, such as shown in Figure 22.1, but more often prices spike down\nbriefly (a day or two), then return and move downward or horizontally before\nbreaking out and heading up.\nThe formation was popularized by William J. O’Neil in his book, How to\nMake Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill, 1988). In his introduction to the forma-\ntion, he identifies many characteristics that high, tight flags share.\nBriefly, O’Neil looked for a doubling of the stock price in less than 2\nmonths, a sideways move of 3 to 5 weeks during creation of the flag with price\ndrifting down no more than 20% in the flag. The guidelines eliminated many\npatterns so that fewer than 10% qualified. I followed none of them. I pro-\ngrammed my computer to identify all stocks that had a minimum price rise of\n100% in 2 months or less. Then I manually went through each stock and looked\nfor a nearby consolidation region. If the region was close to the 100% price\ngain, then I accepted it as a high, tight flag.\nFor example, Figure 22.1 passes all the O’Neil guidelines, whereas Figure\n22.2 does not (if you apply them strictly).

    "text": "low of 5.25 in early July then starts moving up. In early September, it reaches\na price of 10.25, just shy of doubling. Admittedly, the 95% price gain is less\nthan a strict interpretation of the O’Neil guidelines, but it comes close. The\nhigh, tight flag slopes downward for 38 days, 3 more days than the maximum,\nand declines by 22%, 2% over the threshold. You could argue that the num-\nbers are close enough to the O’Neil guidelines to qualify as a high, tight flag. I\naccept it as a flag.\nTable 22.1 shows the guidelines I used in selecting and evaluating high,\ntight flags.\nSubstantial rise. First, there must be a short, quick rise. By that, I mean a\nrise in which price nearly doubles in 2 months or less. It can move up more than\nthat, and the rise need not take place from a flat base (horizontal price move-\nment). In the HTFs I found, I visually looked for a doubling of the price in 2\nmonths and then let my computer determine when the trend started (see\n“Trend Start” in Glossary and Methodology for details).\nFinal consolidation. Once the stocks are selected on a price-rise basis,\nthen look for the nearest consolidation area. In my selections, I did not care\nhow long the stock consolidated nor how far the flag descended before turning\nupward. All that mattered was that the consolidation area was plainly visible to\nthe casual observer. The consolidation area should be about double the price\nof the prior 2-month low.\nReceding volume trend. The final identification guideline is not really\nfor identification as much as it is for performance. Flags with a receding vol-\nume trend outperform those without. However, I would not ignore a high,\ntight flag simply because volume is rising. Rather, I would recognize that its\nperformance may suffer.\nFocus on Failures\nInvesting in a stock showing a high, tight flag is not without risk. Figure 22.3\nshows a flag that suffers from a small rise. Since one would expect a stock to\nmove up substantially after the breakout, I consider this behavior a failure of\nthe stock to perform as expected.\nFocus on Failures\n353\nTable 22.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nSubstantial rise\nA rise lasting less than 2 months carries prices upward at\nleast 90% (shoot for a doubling of the stock price).\nFind consolidation\nLocate a consolidation area, where prices pause in the\nprevailing uptrend near where price doubles from the trend\nstart.\nReceding volume trend\nThe volume trend in the flag should be receding for best\nperformance.",

When prices head lower in the flag\nportion of the formation (marked in this case by two down-sloping trend lines),\nvolume recedes. The flag drifts lower for almost a month before breaking out of\nthe trend and heading up. After rising for just over a week to a new high, the stock\ncurls around and meanders lower.

To calculate\nthe price target, find where the trend starts and measure the price change from\nthe low at the start to the HTF high (the highest high in the pattern). Divide the\nresult in half and add it to the HTF’s low price. The result is the target that\nprice reaches 90% of the time. Look for price to stall once it nears the target.\nTo find the trend start, see the Glossary and Methodology for details.\nBuy after breakout. Since the price rise in the first week is the largest\none-week change you are likely to see, place a stop order to buy the stock just\nabove the HTF trend-line boundary. If the HTF has an irregular shape, use\nthe top of the pattern as the buy point and place the buy stop there.\nIf price closes below the flag pattern, sell your position immediately\nbecause price is going down. Reversals do happen, so be on guard for one.\nOnce you have a position in the stock, raise your stop to just below the prior\nminor low when price makes a new high. Keep raising the stop as prices rise.\nEventually, this method will take you out when the trend changes or during a\nsevere retrace.\nSample Trade\nWhen John spotted the high, tight flag shown in Figure 22.4, he wasted no\ntime in taking a position, buying when price pierced the upper trend line at\npoint A.

When it did, he bit and piled into the stock again at 6.50. He con-\nsidered the bottom of the flag a support area, so that is the price he used as his\nstop loss.

The remain-\ning gap, the ex-dividend gap, is not considered because it rarely happens and has\nno investment significance. The ex-dividend gap usually occurs in utility stocks\nor stocks with high-paying dividends. On the day of dividend distribution, the\nprice sometimes moves downward leaving a gap in the price chart. Even though\nthe price of the stock after distribution reduces by the dividend amount, the\nday’s trading range often fills the gap so no actual gap appears on the chart.\nI define closing the gap to be when prices return and span the gap completely.\nThe area gap closes quickest, with nearly 90% of those gaps closing within a week.\nListed in the Results Snapshot table is the average time it takes price to\nclose the gap. Sometimes gaps close quickly (such as exhaustion gaps) because\nthey are found near the ends of trends where price reverses and fills the gap.\nOther gaps take much longer since they mark the start of a strong trend (break-\naway gap). The continuation gap is a combination of the two because it com-\nmonly appears in the middle of trends.\nGaps had a few surprises. I found that larger gaps appear in bear markets\nfor some reason. Performance improves for gaps in bull markets when they\nappear near the yearly high. Finally, large gaps perform better than small ones.\nTour\nA gap appears in an uptrend price series when yesterday’s daily high is below\ntoday’s low price. A downtrend gap is similar, being created when yesterday’s\nlow is above today’s high. In both cases, some type of exuberance is driving the\nstock to create a gap. It sometimes is nothing more than the stock being worth\nless simply because of a dividend distribution. At other times, the repercussions\nare more severe. An earnings surprise, either positive or negative, often causes\na gap and the stock to rise by 10% or 15% or to decline by 30% or more,\ndepending on the severity of the news.\nFigure 23.1 shows a plethora of different gap types. Area gaps occur in\ncongestion zones, usually when prices are moving sideways. Price gaps up or\ndown and the gaps close quickly. Of all the gap types, area gaps are common,\nappearing all over the place. Breakaway gaps appear at the start of trends. They,\ntoo, are quite numerous and accompany high volume. Usually there is some\nfundamental event driving the stock, creating a breakaway gap. Continuation\nTour\n363",

    "text": "gaps are relatively rare because they appear in the middle of strong trends.\nThose trends themselves do not occur very often and even less often do they\ncontain a gap. Exhaustion gaps signal the end of trends. They are the last jump\nup or down before the trend either reverses or moves sideways.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 23.1 lists identification guidelines for gaps.\nArea gaps. Area, common, or pattern gaps are all names for the same type\nof gap. The gap forms inside or just after a consolidation region. It is easy to\nspot as prices seem to hook around and close the gap in less than a week (many\ntimes in the next trading session). Figure 23.2 shows many examples of this\nhook feature: For example, you can see in late March that prices gap down and\nthe next day the high closes the area gap. A quick hook such as that is charac-\nteristic of area gaps. Usually, few or no new highs (for uptrends) or lows (when\nprice gaps lower) occur immediately after the gap.\nVolume may be high on the day price gaps but usually settles down\nquickly. You can see this behavior in late January. Volume spikes on the gap\nday then returns to normal the next day.\nBreakaway gap. Breakaway gaps highlight the start of a new trend. Volume\nrises substantially above the prior day and price gaps upward and continues rising\n(or falling in the case of a descending price gap) forming new highs (or lows).\nConsider the breakaway gap in early January shown in Figure 23.2.

    "text": "rising volume trend. Then prices level out and move horizontally for several\nweeks before gapping down in an area gap. Two days later, another breakaway\ngap (not labeled on the chart) appears and prices reach new daily highs for 3\ndays in a row before settling back.\nThe large breakaway gap in mid-April, accompanied by a high volume\nspike, is not an exhaustion gap because price continues rising. The June break-\naway gap begins after a minor congestion area but the gap could be a continu-\nation (gap) of the downward price move of a week earlier. Volume spikes\nupward as price makes a large gap. Usually large gaps are associated with\nexhaustion gaps, but prices continue moving lower after just a few days.\nContinuation gaps. Continuation gaps occur in the middle of price\ntrends. They do not happen often since it takes a sharp rise followed by a gap\nand a continued rise in the stock (the reverse for downtrends, too). In Figure\n23.2, you can see two continuation gaps in August when prices zoom from a\nlow of 23.50 to 32.63 in about 2 weeks. The gaps appear in the quick, sharp\nprice rise on high, but not unusually high, volume. The quick rise forms new\nhighs and the gap remains open (compare these continuation gaps with how\nquickly the area gap closes). Of course, in a downtrend, prices gap downward\nand form new lows.\nEx-dividend gaps. An ex-dividend gap appears on the price chart when a\ndividend-paying stock distributes the dividend. Usually, however, the normal\ntrading range will cover the gap.\nExhaustion gaps. Exhaustion gaps commonly follow continuation gaps.\nThe highest gap in the August uptrend is an exhaustion gap. At first I thought\nit was another continuation gap, but the gap is slightly larger than normal and\nprices pause for 2 days before making new highs. Those are some key factors\nassociated with exhaustion gaps. Excessively wide gaps are most likely exhaus-\ntion gaps when they appear near the end of a trend. Two exhaustion gaps appear\non the chart, one in August and one in September. The September gap closes\nquickly, which is typical for exhaustion gaps.\nMost exhaustion gaps occur on high volume; it is like the last gasp before\nprices end the trend. You can see in Figure 23.2 that both exhaustion gaps have\nhigh volume, but the September one takes the cake. Volume spikes upward\neven as prices descend, then volume recedes but remains high for several days\nafter the gap. The high volume highlights the struggle of investors who want\nto purchase the stock at a good price with those who are trying to get out of the\nsituation at the best offer.\nStatistics: Area Gaps\nTable 23.2 shows general statistics for area gaps.\nNumber of formations. I found 484 area gaps in 97 stocks from mid-\n1991 to early 2004, but I did not cover all years in between. Since I was look-\ning for the time to close the gap, I found little need for additional samples.\n366\nGaps",

    "text": "Trading Tactics and Sample Trade\nTable 23.6 lists trading tactics for gaps. To successfully trade gaps you have to\nbe quick, making sure to use stops, and you have to be ready to close out a trade\nat a moment’s notice. Still, they can be profitable. Consider what Gina did with\nthe situation shown in Figure 23.3.\nAs a seasoned investor, Gina knew all about gaps and practiced trading\nthem on paper until she was successful most of the time. The practice honed\nher skills and pulling the trigger seemed rote. With a focus on limiting her\nlosses, she was growing confident that her trading style was one that would\nallow her to succeed in the markets, so she took the leap and decided to trade\nher system for real.\nShe followed the stock for a long time and was both familiar and com-\nfortable with the fundamentals of the company. When she noticed the break-\naway gap occur on May 10, she quickly checked the identification guidelines.\nVolume was above average (although it may not be clear from the chart) and a\nnew upward price trend seemed to be forming. She called her broker and\nbought 1,000 shares receiving a fill at 58 that day.\nShe placed a stop-loss order at 57, 0.13 below the lower gap rim just to\nbe safe. If this turned out to be an area gap, she would probably be stopped out\nfor a small loss. During her paper trading days, she discovered that most gaps\nprovide near-term support or resistance, so she was confident that her stop\nwould hold.\nTrading Tactics and Sample Trade\n371\nTable 23.6\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nArea gaps\nThese gaps are too short-lived to be traded profitably, consistently.\nBreakaway gaps\nIf high volume is present at the start of a trend, then trade with\nthe trend. Verify gap type by reviewing the identification\nguidelines before trading.\nContinuation gaps\nContinuation gaps usually mark the halfway point so you can\ngauge the eventual price move. Measure from the trend start to\nthe gap center and project the difference from the gap center to\nthe predicted high or low.\nExhaustion gaps\nIf an abnormally wide gap occurs or a gap occurs at the end of a\ntrend, then close out your position when the trend reverses. After\na trend reversal, consider trading the new trend (shorting the\nstock if the prior trend was up). Violent reversals often follow\nexhaustion gaps. Close out the trade the day after new highs (for\nuptrends) or new lows (downtrends) fail to occur.\nStop loss\nThe lower rim (for uptrends) or the higher rim (for downtrends) of\na gap is a good place to put a stop (0.15 or so away from the rim).\nGaps provide near-term support or resistance, so this strategy\nworks well with those gaps that do not close quickly.",

In my quest to sell at the appropriate time, I have often over-\nlooked the buy side: bottom reversals. Head-and-shoulders bottoms are just\nsuch a formation. They are quite easy to spot and can be very profitable.\nThe Results Snapshot highlights statistics for this bullish reversal. Like\nthe top version of the formation, the bottom sports an exceedingly low failure\nrate. Only a few formations climb by less than 5%. Those in a bull market rise\nby 38% in a bull market and 30% in a bear market.\nHSBs have a few surprises in store for traders, including breakout day\ngaps that help power the stock upward.

Figure 24.1 shows a good example of a\nhead-and-shoulders bottom. The stock peaks during February, where the fig-\nure begins.

By mid-August\n1995(not shown), the stock is trading just below 60.\nAccording to new statistics, the head-and-shoulders bottom shown in\nFigure 24.1 has a typical volume pattern. Volume is usually highest on the\nhead, then the left shoulder, and even lower on the right shoulder. The rise\nfrom the head to the right shoulder accompanies a rise in volume as does the\nactual breakout.\nIn contrast, the formation shows little increase in volume during the rise\nfrom the head to the right shoulder. Volume on the breakout is unexciting and\nthat helps explain why the stock stalls. Upward momentum fails to carry price\nmuch higher; the stock rounds over and heads back down.\nFigure 24.2 shows a head-and-shoulders formation on a weekly time\nscale. I chose this chart to show you the typical trend of head-and-shoulders\nbottom reversals. They usually form after an extended downtrend in prices. As\na reversal, once they complete, prices rise.\nWhy do HSBs form? The chart pattern represents a struggle to find the\nbottom, the lowest price that represents the best value. As the stock descends\nduring February 1994, investors nibble at the stock in increasing numbers.\nVolume climbs even as the stock descends until it spikes upward for 1 week\nduring formation of the left shoulder. Buying demand puts a crimp on the\ndownward slide and prices move up but only for a week. The following week,\nprices move lower.

The left shoulder has very\nhigh volume, the head exhibits somewhat less volume, and the right shoulder\nrecords the lowest volume up to that point. Only after prices start moving up\nfrom the right shoulder does volume spike upward.\nBreakout volume, depending on where you determine the breakout\noccurs, is unconvincing. In late August, prices move decidedly above the neck-\nline and stage a definitive breakout. Even so, it is not until 2 weeks later that\nvolume advances noticeably.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 24.1 encapsulates the identification guidelines for HSBs. Consider Figure\n24.3, a head-and-shoulders bottom. The formation does not appear at the end of\na long-term downtrend but at a short-term one (up to 3 months). The uptrend\nbegins the prior June with another head-and-shoulders bottom. The formation\nreverses the slight short-term downtrend but continues the long-term uptrend.\nShape. Overall, the formation sports the three telltale troughs: left shoul-\nder, head, and right shoulder. The left shoulder is at about the same price level\nas the right one and appears to be about the same width. Such symmetry is\ncommon in head-and-shoulders formations (tops, bottoms, and the complex\nvariety). If the left shoulder is sharp or pointed, the right shoulder will be too.\nThe head is below both shoulders by a reasonable amount. By this char-\nacteristic I mean the formation is not a triple bottom—three troughs at about\nthe same price level.\nIdentification Guidelines\n377\nTable 24.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nA three-trough formation with the center trough below the other\ntwo. It looks like a head-and-shoulders bust flipped upside down.\nThe three troughs and two minor rises should appear well defined.\nSymmetry\nThe left and right shoulders should be opposite one another about\nthe head, somewhat equidistant in both time and price. There are\nwide variations, but the formation is noticeably symmetrical about\nthe head.\nVolume\nUsually highest on the left shoulder or head and diminished on the\nright shoulder.\nNeckline\nA line that connects the rise between the two shoulders. A neckline\npierce signals an upward breakout. For up-sloping necklines, use\nthe highest high in the pattern as the breakout price.\nUpward breakout\nThe breakout is upward, usually on high volume that powers\nprices upward.

    "text": "In Figure 24.3, the left shoulder suddenly declines for 3 days, then\nreverses and climbs to a minor high. Similarly, the rise between the head and\nright shoulder climbs almost to the height of the rise between the left shoulder\nand head then descends to the right shoulder. All five features, the three\ntroughs and two minor rises, appear well defined and distinct. The features are\nimportant as you scan your charts looking for head-and-shoulders bottoms.\nSymmetry. Symmetry is another important key to selecting a valid head-\nand-shoulders bottom. The right side of the formation usually mimics the left\nside. The right shoulder declines to about the price level of the left shoulder\nand the distances of both from the head are similar. Of course, there are many\nvariations, but symmetry should make a head-and-shoulders bottom stand out\nfrom a sequence of any three depressions.\nVolume. Volume represents another clue to the validity of a bottom.\nThe left shoulder or head has the highest volume, with diminished volume on\nthe right shoulder.\nBreakout volume is usually high as it pushes prices above the neckline.\nHowever, in a quarter of the formations in a bull market, breakout volume is\nwell below the 30-day average. As a rule, volume will rise on the day of the\nbreakout, but it need not.\nNeckline. The neckline is an imaginary line connecting the two rises\nbetween the shoulders and the head. It can slope downward or upward. In\nwell-formed formations, the slope of the line is not very steep, but a steep\nneckline should not be a disqualifier of a head-and-shoulders bottom (see Fig-\nure 24.1—it has a rather steep neckline).\n378\nHeads-and-Shoulders Bottoms\nAug\nFeb 95\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJul\nJun\n3 Com Corp.

    "text": "Upward breakout. When price closes above a down-sloping trend line\nor above the highest high in the pattern, that occurrence marks a breakout. Use\nthe formation high as the breakout point instead of an up-sloping neckline\nbecause you will get a by signal sooner. You may never get a signal in an HSB\nwith a steep up-sloping neckline.\nFocus on Failures\nLike most formations, there are two types of failures. The first type, shown in\nFigure 24.4, is a failure of the head-and-shoulders bottom to pierce the neckline\nand move higher. As you would expect, the formation appears after a downtrend\nin prices. The highest price peak is partly visible in the upper left corner of Fig-\nure 24.4. From the high of 38.75, prices fall to the low at the head, 21.25, a\ndecline of 45%. When the bottom forms, it should signal a trend reversal.\nAn interesting thing about the formation in Figure 24.4 is that the left shoul-\nder is almost the same shape as the right. Only a dollar separates the two shoul-\nder lows and the head is well below both shoulder troughs. The right shoulder is\nsomewhat farther away from the head than the left. This characteristic is typical.\nVolume is suspiciously low throughout the formation. The left shoulder\nand head register about the same level of volume. The right shoulder volume,\nhowever, is higher than the other two. Of course, an irregular volume pattern\nis no reason to discard a formation—but it serves as a warning.\nAfter the right shoulder forms and price begins rising, volume tapers off\nrapidly, and the attempt to pierce the neckline fails. The rally attempt does not\neven come close to the neckline.\nFocus on Failures\n379\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nMar 94\nApr\nMay\nJul\nJun\nASA Holdings (Air Transport, NASDAQ, ASAI)\nHead\nLeft\nShoulder\nRight\nShoulder\n– 38\n– 36\n– 34\n– 32\n– 30\n– 28\n– 26\n– 24\n– 22\n– 20\n– 18\n– 16\n– 14\n– 12\n– 10\n–   8\nFigure 24.4\nFailure of a head-and-shoulders bottom to stage an upside breakout.",

    "text": "Looking at the overall formation, there is no one item that signals an\nimpending failure. There is some suspicious activity, principally the abnormal\nvolume pattern, but nothing to deter an investor.\nFigure 24.5 shows a slightly different type of failure. This is what I call a 5%\nfailure. The two shoulders and head appear well formed and distinct. The left\nshoulder looks different from the right, but the twin rises between the shoulders\nare similar. The price level of the two shoulders is not suspiciously out of line.\nVolume is unusual. The only heavy volume appears near the head as\nprices rise away from it toward the right shoulder. The right shoulder volume\nlooks like something you would want to tackle with your shaver: annoying but\nnot high enough to be alarming.\nPrice advances smartly after the right shoulder forms. Once price rises\nabove the stair-step incline, it zooms upward for 3 days and then stops. The\nstock moves sideways for 2 weeks before starting back down.\nAlthough this formation does have an upward breakout, price fails to rise\nby more than 5% above the neckline.

After all, if\nyou can locate a normal head-and-shoulders bottom, then there is a decent\nchance that you are also looking at a complex one. If you look to the left and\nright of the two shoulders, you might see additional shoulders. Multiple shoul-\nders are one indication of a complex formation. But before I delve too far into\npattern recognition, let me briefly review the important snapshot statistics.\nThe complex head-and-shoulders bottom (CHSB) is a strong performer\nwith a low break-even failure rate and a very good average gain after the break-\nout. The volume trend slopes downward, and about two-thirds throw back to the\nbreakout price. However, when a throwback occurs, performance suffers. Thus,\nyou should look for nearby overhead resistance and avoid patterns showing it.\nTo improve postbreakout performance, look for patterns with a rising\nvolume trend, random volume shape, or heavy breakout volume, or having a\ndown-sloping neckline.

The left and right shoulders are well defined and the head is below them.\nAs you widen your view, you see an additional pair of shoulders; the left shoul-\nder is about the same distance from the head as the right one. The two outer-\nmost shoulders are near the same price level too.\nLooking at all the shoulders and the head together, the chart is a good\nexample of a complex head-and-shoulders bottom. However, the volume pat-\ntern is unusual as it is heavier on the right than on the left. Most of the time,\nthe left shoulders show higher volume than the right pair, but the head has the\nhighest volume about half the time.\nIf you ignore the various labels, you can see a rounding bottom. Although\nthe volume pattern is not a characteristic bowl-shaped pattern, the gentle turn\nof prices (if you connect the minor lows) supports a bottom formation. How-\never you choose to classify this pattern, the bullish reversal is clear.\nShown in Figure 25.1 is a throwback to the neckline, a common occur-\nrence for the head-and-shoulders family, especially the complex variety.\nAlthough it takes a week or two before prices really begin moving up, the stock\nclimbs to a high of 32.63 before retracing its gains.\nCompare Figure 25.1 with Figure 25.2, a complex bottom with two\nheads.

    "text": "In Figure 25.2, the breakout in mid-November quickly throws back to the\nneckline and moves lower for a week or two. The stock rises but throws back\nagain before finally breaking away and heading higher. By late March the stock\nreaches a high of 16.63, well above the head low of 9.19.\nVolume on the left side of the formation is heavier than on the right. In\nthis regard, the formation is more typical than that shown in Figure 25.1.\nIdentification Guidelines\nAre there certain characteristics that make head-and-shoulders bottoms easy to\nidentify? Yes, and they are outlined in Table 25.1.\nShape. As discussed before, there are two general types of complex head-\nand-shoulder bottoms: those with multiple shoulders and those with multiple\nheads (rarely do you have both). Figure 25.3 shows a complex bottom with\nmultiple shoulders. The head is distinctly below the shoulders, far enough\nbelow to distinguish the chart pattern from a triple bottom.\nSymmetry. In this case, there is a normal head-and-shoulders bottom\nflanked by an additional pair of shoulders. The overall formation appears sym-\nmetrical. The two left shoulders match the two on the right in distance. Fig-\nure 25.3 shows a far right shoulder that is higher than its corresponding left\none. However, the basic symmetrical pattern is typical for nearly all complex\nhead-and-shoulders bottoms.\nVolume. Figure 25.3 also shows the usual volume pattern: The two left\nshoulders show higher volume than the two right ones. Overall, the volume\ntrend is a receding one.\nNear horizontal neckline. The neckline connects the highest peak on\nthe left with the highest peak on the right. Most of the time the line is nearly\nhorizontal. Although this is subjective, a scan of all the formations indicates\nthat 74% obey this guideline. Many of the formations shown in this chapter\nhave near horizontal necklines.\nUpward breakout. For those with up-sloping necklines, use the highest\nhigh in the formation as the breakout price. Using a steep up-sloping neck-\nline to gauge the breakout point is risky. Prices may never close above the \nneckline.\nOnce price closes above the neckline, a breakout occurs. Quite often,\nprices throw back to the neckline and perhaps move lower before ultimately\ncontinuing higher. Figure 25.2 shows an example of this behavior during late\nDecember when prices plunged from a high of 11.50 to 9.44, a decline of\nalmost 20% in just 2 days! When the decline ended, prices recovered quickly.\nThe formation shown in Figure 25.3 is unusual because it acts as a con-\nsolidation of the uptrend. Prices from November through January climb\nsteadily and then resume moving up after the breakout. The formation is a\nconsolidation region, where prices move horizontally for a spell.\nIdentification Guidelines\n393",

When you look\nat your failures as a group, you may begin to see trends. Such is the case with\nchart formations.\nFigure 25.4 shows a typical failure of a complex formation to reverse the\ndowntrend. After the head-and-shoulders formation completes, prices do\nclimb, but only to 57.13. Prices squeeze above the neckline and close there for\njust a handful of days before sliding below the neckline in early March. Ulti-\nmately, the stock reaches 40.63 in August.\nThe left shoulder shows tremendous volume. Volume diminishes at the\ndual heads, and the right shoulder shows even less volume. Breakout volume is\nanemic and may explain why the formation fails.\nI count any formation with prices that fail to rise by more than 5% as a\nfailure. Figure 25.4, for example, falls under the 5% rule. The breakout is\nupward, but prices fail to climb very far before reversing direction. Once prices\ndecline below the head, I know that there is no hope and mark the formation\na failure.\nI found no reliable clues that indicate an eventual failure of a complex\nhead-and-shoulders bottom.

After an upward breakout, over 60% of the time,\nthe stock throws back to the neckline. Consider adding to your position or\nplacing a long trade once prices stop declining. You should wait for prices to\nrebound on a throwback or else you could find yourself in a situation similar to\nthat shown in Figure 25.2. Prices throw back to the neckline and then continue\ndown for over a week. Depending on when you bought the stock, you could\nhave seen a near 10% price improvement if you had waited a few days.\nSample Trade\nWhen the weather is nice, I like to take my bicycle out for a spin and give the\nautomobile drivers something to aim for. On one of my bike trips I met\nMelody. After I told her what I did for a living, she confessed that she was a\nnightclub dancer and made oodles in tips. I was unsure whether I bought her\nstory, but she looked pretty enough (wearing a bike helmet and sun glasses,\nwho can tell?).\nAnyway, she told me about a trade she had made in the stock pictured in\nFigure 25.5. The stock intrigued her because a trend line drawn from the high-\nest high in early October to just after the head marked a turning point. That is\nwhere prices moved up enough to pierce the trend line.\nMelody knew that prices usually retest the low before beginning an\nextended move upward, so she followed the stock and watched it loop around\nand dip to 14. Then she glanced sideways and noticed the other dip at 14.38.\nThat is when she uncovered the (inner) head-and-shoulders bottom.\nA neckline connecting the rises between the two shoulders was impossibly\nsteep; there was no way she could apply the traditional measure rule to deter-\nmine a target price (because price had not closed above the neckline), so she\ndecided to buy into the stock when prices closed above the right shoulder high.\nThis event occurred in late May and she received a fill at 17.50. Taking a\ncloser look at the graph, she saw two more shoulders, one during early Febru-\nary and the mirror image in mid-May, both at 16. Her simple head-and-shoul-\nders bottom changed into the complex variety.\nThe realization did not affect her investment plans at all, but it made the\nsituation more interesting. She wondered if another pair of shoulders would\nappear. Her suspicions were fulfilled during late July when another shoulder\ndeveloped. This one at 15.75 mirrored the shoulder in mid-December 1993.\nSoon, prices began moving up. They climbed above the break-even point in\nmid-August and staged an upward breakout. Now she was able to apply the\nmeasure rule for the complex bottom and found the target was 22.13.\nSample Trade\n403",

A downward breakout was a real possibility, so she raised her stop\nto 21—the height of the plateau in October—and at a price just below where\nthe base seemed to be building.\nIn mid-June, just over a year after she placed the trade, prices zoomed up\nand reached her sell point.

Consult the associated table for more information.\n• Use the identification guidelines to help select the pattern—Table 25.1.\n• Choose patterns in a bull market because they rise the farthest—Table\n25.2.\n• Patterns in a bull market have the lowest failure rates—Table 25.3.\n• Throwbacks hurt performance, so look for overhead resistance before\ntrading—Table 25.4.\n• Breakout day gaps improve performance—Table 25.4.\n• Be patient trading these patterns as it takes a long time to reach the\nultimate high. Expect price weakness a month after the breakout—\nTable 25.5.\n• Select bull market patterns that are both shorter and wider than the\nmedian. In a bear market, patterns that are tall and narrow do best—\nTable 25.6.\n• Pick patterns with a rising volume trend—Table 25.7.\n• Select patterns with a random volume shape (neither U nor dome\nshaped)—Table 25.7.\n• Patterns with heavy breakout volume outperform—Table 25.7.\n• Patterns with down-sloping necklines do best—Table 25.8.\n• Trade patterns with higher far right shoulder lows—Table 25.8.\n404\nHead-and-Shoulders Bottoms, Complex",

Shown is a head-and-shoulders top for-\nmation, but there are four shoulders and only one head. When a formation\nappears with more than the standard two shoulders and one head, it is called a\ncomplex head-and-shoulders pattern. Complex head-and-shoulders patterns\nfor both tops and bottoms have their own chapters, but many appear in this\nchapter’s statistics. They are, after all, head-and-shoulder tops, too.\nThe head-and-shoulders top usually appears at the end of a long uptrend.\nSometimes, when the prior uptrend is of short duration, the reversal takes\nprices down to where they started the climb (see Figure 26.2). At other times,\nthe decline is usually short (up to 3 months) or intermediate (3 to 6 months),\nor can signal a change in the primary bullish trend. The actual length of the\ndecline cannot be predicted.\nSymmetry. Even though the formation shown in Figure 26.3 is some-\nwhat odd, it does have a symmetrical appearance. The two left shoulders are at\nabout the same price level as the corresponding two right shoulders. Each of\nthe shoulders is approximately the same distance from the other and from its\nmirror opposite. In the chart pattern, the head is centrally located. The sym-\nmetrical appearance of a head-and-shoulders top is one of its key identification\ncharacteristics and helps separate any three bumps from a valid head-and-\nshoulders chart pattern.\nVolume.

Notice that the decline is farther (price) and shorter (time) in a bear\nmarket than in a bull market. Thus, the decline must be steeper in a bear mar-\nket. This fact suggests shorting a stock showing an HST in a bear market for\nthe best performance and to maximize the number of trades annually.\nTable 26.3 shows failure rates for HSTs. The best performance is from\nHSTs in a bear market as they have the lowest failure rates. For example, 1%\nof the patterns fails to drop more than 5%. Another example: nearly half (49%)\nfail to drop more than 25% in a bear market. That performance is even worse\nin a bull market as 68% fail to drop more than 25%.\nNotice how the failure rate climbs for small changes in the maximum\nprice decline. The rate triples and then doubles as the decline moves from 5%\nto 15% (bull markets). The numbers should serve as a warning that as reliable\nas HSTs are, not all patterns perform equally well.

The best performance comes from HSTs with horizon-\ntal necklines, but the 33% decline in a bear market uses only two samples. Sec-\nond to that was HSTs with up-sloping necklines. Common sense says that a\ndown-sloping neckline would suggest an especially bearish omen because price\nis already showing weakness. Why HSTs with up-sloping necklines perform\nbetter is a mystery.\nShoulder highs. Does a lower right shoulder predict a more bearish sit-\nuation? Yes. HSTs with a higher left shoulder peak (and lower right shoulder)\ndrop 25% after the breakout in a bull market and 30% in a bear market. When\nthe right shoulder is higher than the left, the decline is 20% in a bull market\nand 27% in a bear market. HSTs with even shoulder highs perform worst.\nTrading Tactics\nShown in Table 26.9 are trading tactics, and Figure 26.5 shows an example of\nthe measure rule as it applies to a head-and-shoulders top. If you ignore the\nbackward volume pattern, the formation looks fine. Each of the three bumps\nappears rounded and the overall formation is symmetrical.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule uses the formation height as a basis for\ncomputing the target price. In the head, measure vertically down from the\nhighest daily high until you intersect the neckline. Subtract the value of the\nneckline from the highest high. The result gives the formation height. In the\nfigure, the stock reaches a high price of 51 on September 13. Directly below\nthat point is the neckline price at about 47.38. The difference of 3.62 is the\nformation height.\nOnce price pierces the neckline, subtract the formation height from the\ndaily high at the breakout point.

Since the target serves as a mini-\nmum price move, prices often continue moving down, as in Figure 26.5.\nThe measure rule, as just described, is the conventional way to compute\na target price. However, it does have a flaw. Consider Figure 26.6. Prices dur-\ning the right trough recession decline to 27.75, well below the higher trough\nat 31.25. A neckline joining the two is too steep. Prices never plunge through\nthe neckline, and it is impossible to compute a target price using the conven-\ntional method. Instead, compute the formation height by taking the difference\nbetween the highest high in the head and the lowest low in the highest trough\n(point A on the chart). After finding the formation height, subtract the value\nfrom point A to get the target price. In this example, the highest high is at\n33.63 and the lowest low at the highest trough is 31.25, giving a height of 2.38.\nSubtract the result from 31.25 to get a target of 28.87. Figure 26.6 shows this\nvalue, and prices reach the target during mid-April.\nThe alternative method has two advantages. First, it can always be calcu-\nlated and is somewhat easier to use since it does not rely on the value of the\nneckline. Second, it is more accurate, achieving a success rate of 62%, mean-\ning that more formations exceed the price target using this alternative method\nrather than the conventional one.\nWait for confirmation.

When her husband brings\nhome the bacon, she not only fries it but cleans up the mess afterward. She bal-\nances the books and keeps tabs on their newborn.\nShe started investing years ago for fun. Now, it has become part of her\ndaily life. In the spare moments between chores, she is often staring at the\ncomputer screen, reviewing the statistics of a prospective acquisition and let-\nting her daughter bang on the keyboard.\nOver the years she has been able to parlay their meager savings into a six-\nfigure retirement portfolio. It was not always easy and the mistakes were\npainful, but she viewed each failure as a learning experience.\nThe stock pictured in Figure 26.6 posed an interesting situation for her.\nShe was not keen on shorting a stock because her paper trades rarely worked.\nStill, she kept her eyes open and searched for good investment candidates.\nThis one piqued her interest.\nThe stock began its uphill run just before May 1993. It followed a gently\nsloping trend line upward until late January when it stumbled. The stock\nmoved down to 26.50 before recovering, a drop of less than three points, but a\nsign of weakness. Kelly followed the stock closely and when the head appeared,\nshe made a note on her program that it might turn into a head-and-shoulders\ntop. “It just had that certain feel.” She was correct.\nThe right shoulder plunge took prices lower than she expected but\nquickly recovered to near the left shoulder high. She drew a neckline below the\ntwo valleys and thought the line was too steep to serve as an anchor for the\nmeasure rule, so she used the alternate measure rule and computed a target\nprice of just 28.88. This did not seem right either, so she used the right shoul-\nder low to compute another target. This one turned out to be 21.88, or the\nheight from the head to the right shoulder valley projected downward from the\nvalley low. That target would take prices back to the July 1993 level and it\nseemed reasonable to her.\nStill, something bothered her about the stock and she decided not to\ntrade it.

The number of shorted shares was just 100, an\namount she could live with. Prices quickly retreated to the neckline where they\nfound support. The stock bounced and when it moved above the right shoul-\nder low, she got concerned. After a few days, the stock leveled out and moved\nsideways. In case this turned out to be the beginning of a measured move up,\nshe placed an order to cover her trade at 29. That would leave her with a small\nprofit but still allow her to participate if the stock declined.\nTwo weeks later, she had an answer. The stock tumbled for 5 days in a\nrow, then just as quickly recovered, only this time it formed a lower high. The\nvolatility was wearing her down so she placed an order with her broker to\ncover her position when prices reached the old low.

He probably told himself that\nhe would sell the stock once it returned to its old high.\nIn early January, prices zoom upward and make a smaller peak at 27.50.\nSince the rise is so steep, our intrepid investor thinks, why sell the stock when it\nis going to go higher? He is right. Price retraces a bit then moves higher and\nforms the head at a price of 28.63. Once the head completes, things start to go\nwrong for our buddy. He is swayed by glowing predictions on the Internet of\nthe stock moving up to 35 or 40 within a year.\nAt the top, prices round over and start down. They stop midway between\nthe troughs of the two left shoulders before making one final attempt at a new\nhigh. Up to this point, there are several opportunities to sell the stock at a good\nprice. Did our novice investor take them? Probably not. Always optimistic that\nprices will ultimately break out and reach higher ground, he does not see the\nbudding complex head-and-shoulders formation for what it is: a warning.\nWhen prices drop below the neckline, our novice investor has just 2 days\nbefore things really get going. On the third day the stock closes at 23, near the\nlow for the day. Prices quickly unravel and ultimately reach a low of 15, just a\nfew dollars above the purchase price. That is when our investor throws in the\ntowel and sells the stock. Of course, this is near the low and the stock ulti-\nmately climbs to 30 a year later.\nIdentification Guidelines\nHow can our novice investor recognize the bearish reversal? Table 27.1 out-\nlines some identification tips of a complex head-and-shoulders top.\nShape. Consider Figure 27.3, another example of a multiple shoulder chart\npattern. After a decline from a head-and-shoulders formation just off the left side\nof the chart (only the right shoulder appears in the figure), prices decline until\nreaching bottom at the start of July. Then they rise up, haltingly, and form a new\nhead-and-shoulders formation: a complex top. If you ignore the labels for a\nmoment, the inner price action looks like a rounding top. This smooth price\nrollover is common for complex head-and-shoulder formations. Of course, the\nflat head shape for a multiple shoulder pattern (Figure 27.2) is also typical.\nSymmetry. You can divide Figure 27.3 into a pure head-and-shoulders\nformation by ignoring the outer shoulders. For single-head formations, this is\nthe easiest way to correctly identify a complex head-and-shoulders top. First\nlocate a regular head-and-shoulders pattern and then expand your view to\ninclude additional shoulders. In this example, the head rises above the sur-\nrounding shoulders. The two shoulders are usually equidistant, or nearly so,\nfrom the head. The price level of the left and right shoulders is very nearly the\nsame. Thus, the symmetry of a complex head-and-shoulders top is more pro-\nnounced than that of a regular head-and-shoulders formation.\n424\nHeads-and-Shoulders Tops, Complex",

    "text": "In a regular head-and-shoulders formation, one shoulder may be higher\nin price than the other or one shoulder will be much further away from the\nhead—a rather extended shoulder. That is usually not the case with the com-\nplex variety. Symmetry is paramount and a key identification element.\nMoving to the outer shoulders, they also are equidistant from the head and\nare very nearly at the same price level as well. Continuing the symmetry exam-\nple, the two peaks labeled left shoulder 1 and right shoulder 1 appear to be\nshoulders of the same formation, although further away than the inner grouping.\nIf you consider the inner quad of shoulders as part of the head, then what\nremains is a large, regular head-and-shoulders formation. This formation is\ndenoted by left shoulder 1, right shoulder 1, and the large, rounded head (com-\nposed of five minor highs). Even the outer neckline supports this example as\nprices touch the line several times before dropping through it in a 1-day\ndecline of about four points.\nVolume. If you could zoom in on the volume pattern, you would see it is\nmarginally heavier on the left side of the formation than on the right, at least\nfor the formation bounded by the inner (higher) neckline. High volume on the\nleft side of the formation as compared to the right is typical for complex head-\nand-shoulders formations and occurs about two-thirds of the time.\nNeckline and breakout. The neckline joins the lows of the lowest\ntrough and is interpreted the same way as a normal head-and-shoulders top.\nOnce price pierces the neckline, a downward breakout occurs and prices move\nlower. Volume typically rises on a breakout and can remain high for several\ndays, depending on the severity of the decline.\nFocus on Failures\nComplex head-and-shoulders patterns suffer two types of failures. Both are\nrare. Figure 27.4 shows the first type. I define a downward breakout as a close\nbelow the neckline, or in the case of steep necklines, a close below the lowest\nshoulder trough. Figure 27.4 shows price declining below the neckline only\nonce on May 8 but closing above it. From that point, prices rise and move\nabove the highest head and an upward breakout occurs.\nThe formation itself is well formed. It has two heads at about the same\nlevel and two shoulders also near the same price level. Symmetry throughout\nthe formation looks good, too, as the shoulders are equidistant from the head.\nVolume appears heavier on the left shoulder than on the right, as you would\nexpect. Only during the decline from the right head to the right shoulder does\nvolume rise. In short, there is no real indication that price will fail to continue\nmoving down, but it does.\nFigure 27.5 shows a slightly different situation. The stock suffers a 1-day\ndrop of $2 at the breakout, but then rises in an ascending broadening wedge\n426\nHeads-and-Shoulders Tops, Complex",

Under such circumstances, prices may never pierce the neckline and\nyet the stock is tumbling. Fortunately, the neckline rarely slopes steeply in\ncomplex formations. However, if you do run across a formation with a plung-\ning neckline, use the lowest of the shoulder troughs as the breakout price.\nCompute the formation height in the normal manner, but subtract the height\nfrom the trough value to get a target price.\nA slightly more conservative measure rule computes the formation height\nfrom the highest high to the higher of the neckline troughs. Then subtract the\nresult from the higher of the neckline troughs and the result is the target price.\nThis method works between 51% (bear markets) and 62% (bull markets) of \nthe time.\n434\nHeads-and-Shoulders Tops, Complex\nStandard Microsystems Corp.

    "text": "Using the chart pattern shown in Figure 27.6 as an example, the highest\nhigh is at 31.63 and the higher of the two neckline troughs is at point A, 27.50\n(using the daily low price). This gives a formation height of 4.13 (31.63 –\n27.50) and a target price of 23.38 (or 27.50 – 4.12). Prices reach the target dur-\ning the large 1-day decline on March 2.\nIf the head-and-shoulders formation does not occur after an extended\nupward trend—the situation shown in Figure 27.1—then prices will probably\ndrop back to the low where the formation began. In Figure 27.1, the low just\nbefore prices start rising to the formation is about 28. That is the level to\nwhich prices return after the breakout.\nAt other times, the formation will suddenly shoot up from a base, then\njust as quickly return to the base. Figures 27.2 and 27.5 show examples of this\nsituation.\nWait for confirmation. Since a simple head-and-shoulders pattern\nmakes up a CHST, trade the inner head-and-shoulders. That strategy may\nallow you to place a trade sooner than waiting for price to close below the\nneckline or shoulder low. For conservative investors, wait for the CHST to\nconfirm (when price closes below the neckline or shoulder low). If you own the\nstock, sell it after confirmation because price is going down. Count on it!\nShort stop. For short positions, look for areas of strength—resistance\nlevels—and place a stop-loss order just above that level. Common resistance\nlevels are the shoulder troughs, shoulder tops, and head top. Should the price\nrise above the highest high in the CHST, cover the short, as price is likely to\ncontinue climbing.\nWatch for pullback. Sometimes price breaks out downward then\nregroups and rises above the neckline before plunging down again (see Figure\n27.1 and 27.3). These extended pullbacks and regular pullbacks are good places\nto initiate a short sale or add to a short position.\nSample Trade\nHenry runs a small hedge fund. He considered buying into the stock shown in\nFigure 27.6, but needed more bullish evidence. In August 1994, indicators he\nuses on a daily basis confirmed a buy signal, so he bought shares for his fund at\nan average price of about 17.25.\nIn January 1995, Henry suspected the end was near, so he began taking a\ncloser look at the fundamentals. He was so engrossed with his research on the\ncompany that he failed to notice a pattern forming. Over drinks with his fund\nmanager friends, he shared with them what he had dug up about the company.\nThe news was not good.\n“So that’s why it’s making a broadening top!” one remarked. Henry fur-\nrowed his brow and pictured the price action in his mind and there it was, a\nbroadening top, just like his friend had said.\nSample Trade\n435",

    "text": "The next day Henry pulled up the chart and looked at it more closely. He\nsaw higher highs and lower lows (see the zoom out in Figure 27.6), character-\nistic of a broadening pattern. Coupled with his fundamental research on the\ncompany, he knew it was nearing time to sell, but not yet. He wanted to sell at\nthe top, when prices tagged the top trend line.\nIn early February, when prices attempted to reach the previous high, they\nfell short, dipped down for a few days, and tried again (the two right shoulders).\nThe second rise was even shorter than the prior one, signaling weakness, so\nHenry started selling immediately.\nThe failure to sail across the formation and touch the top of the broad-\nening formation meant it was a partial rise. A partial rise in a broadening top\nusually means one thing: A downward breakout will follow.\nBy the time the stock pulled back up to the base of the two right shoul-\nders (point B), Henry had sold his holdings. As he was getting ready to leave\nhis office for home, something on his computer screen caught his eye. The\nbroadening pattern had changed into a complex head-and-shoulders top.\nThere were the two left shoulders balancing the two right ones with a head\nperched in the center.\nHenry discussed the new situation with his mentor and his fund manager\nbuddies, then decided to short the stock. By the time prices reached the long-\nterm up trend line, he had a tidy sum sold short.\nTwo days later, prices tumbled. They dropped 20% or $5 a share in 1 day\nand continued down. In less than a week, they were at 16 before finding some\nsupport, a plummet of 36%.\nHenry had studied the behavior of dead-cat bounces, and he pulled out\nhis notes and brushed up. He knew the stock would bounce upward, usually\nwithin a week, then trend lower.\nTrue to form, prices moved up a bit (to 18.13), but it was not the smooth,\nrounded bounce he expected. In the coming days, prices moved lower, so\nHenry quit complaining, but he watched the situation closely.\nThe stock bottomed out at about 16 and trended horizontally. To him, it\nlooked as if the stock were building a base and preparing for an upward move,\nso he covered half his short position. In late April, when prices jumped up to\n18.50, he immediately covered the remainder of his position.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select CHSTs that per-\nform better after the breakout.

    "text": "I first discovered the horn bottom formation while pondering a result from my\nstudy of double bottoms. Double bottom formations with bottoms closer\ntogether perform better than those spaced widely apart. What would happen\nif you considered formations that have bottoms only a week or so apart? I\ntested the idea and discovered that the formation performs well.\nHorns have low break-even failure rates, as the Results Snapshot shows,\nand the average rise is above that of other bullish chart patterns. You can\nimprove performance by selecting your patterns carefully. The surprising find-\nings describe some of what to look for. For example, if there is overhead resis-\ntance to the upward breakout nearby, then the horn pattern is more likely to\nthrow back. When a throwback occurs, performance suffers. I discuss this and\nother surprises in the coming pages.\nTour\nFigure 28.1 shows what a horn bottom looks like. After peaking in late Decem-\nber 1993, prices plummet from a high of 50.75 to the horn low at a base of\n30.75. On the left side of the horn, prices have a large weekly price range of\nabout $7.

From that point, prices move\nup and more than double from the horn low in about a year and a half.\nIdentification Guidelines\nHow do you correctly identify horn bottoms? Table 28.1 shows identification\ncharacteristics.\nWeekly chart, downward spikes. Horns are visible on weekly charts.\nAlthough they appear on daily charts, weekly charts make selection easier. For\nthe formation on the left in Figure 28.2, the chart shows two long, downward\nprice spikes separated by a week. The low of the center week stays well above\neither of the spike lows, emphasizing the inverted horn shape of the formation.\nLooking back over the months, you can see that there are no downward\nspikes that come near the length of the horn spikes (as measured from the low-\nest low to the lower of the two adjacent weeks). The twin horns mark an\nunusual event, one that an investor should pay attention to.\nClear visibility. For the left formation in Figure 28.2, the horn appears\nafter a downward price trend, allowing clear visibility to the left of the forma-\ntion, as no downward trends or price outliers obscure the view. This visibility\nis important in that the formation should stand alone and not be part of a con-\ngestion region. It should mark the turning point of a downward price trend.\nThe formation shown on the right of the chart in Figure 28.2 is what a\nhorn bottom looks like in an uptrend. There is a small price retrace, of 3 weeks’\nduration, just as the horn bottoms out. These few weeks separate the formation\nfrom the surrounding price action and allow easy recognition.\nThe two spikes share the same low price, 14.50, and have good price\noverlap (as the right spike almost completely overlaps the left one). You can\n440\nHorn Bottoms\nTable 28.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nWeekly chart, \nUse the weekly chart and locate two downward price spikes \ndownward spikes\nseparated by a week. The two spikes should be longer than similar\nspikes over the prior year and be well below the low of the center\nweek. The formation should look like an inverted horn.\nAbnormally long spikes result in better performance.\nClear visibility\nIn a downtrend, the horn lows should be well below the\nsurrounding lows, especially to the left of the formation for several\nweeks (or months). Usually, horns appear near the end of declines\nbut also happen on retraces in uptrends (where visibility is less\nclear to the left).\nConfirmation\nThe pattern becomes a valid horn bottom when price closes above\nthe highest high in the 3-week pattern.",

That is certainly true, but most of the prices show remarkably even\nbottoms, not a jagged coastline.\nConfirmation. The twin bottom pattern confirms as a valid horn bottom\nwhen price closes above the highest high in the 3-week pattern. Without con-\nfirmation, you have no horn. \nFocus on Failures\nEven though horn bottoms sport a low failure rate, they still fail. Consider Fig-\nure 28.3, a 5% failure or a horn bottom. A 5% failure is when prices start out\nin the correct direction but falter (rising by no more than 5%), turn around,\nand head back down. The twin, downward price spikes look good in that they\nare long and with good overlap. They form as part of a retrace from the high,\nand prices usually return to form a second high (a double top), or perhaps\nmove even higher. If you believe that this stock will form a second top, then\nthis formation is probably not worth betting on as the price appreciation\npotential is just not exciting.\nIf you look at this formation differently, you might suspect that it will\nform a head-and-shoulders top. The left shoulder is already visible in late May\n1994 and another shoulder could form as part of a mirror image, probably in\nApril or May of 1995.

A throwback on the weekly scale is comparatively rare.\nThe throwback must have occurred within a month (four bars). I excluded any\nthrowback taking longer than that. About a quarter of the horns in a bull mar-\nket and half the ones in a bear market threw back to the breakout price. It took\n17 days, on average, for price to make the journey. When prices did throw\nback, performance suffered. For example, in a bull market, horns with throw-\nbacks showed rises averaging 26%. When a throwback did not occur, the rise\naveraged 39%—a substantial difference.\nTable 28.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high. In\na bear market, 24% of the horns reached the ultimate high in the first week,\nbut just 17% topped out in a bull market. After 70 days, a third (32%) of the\nbear market patterns and over half (56%) of the bullish ones were still search-\ning for the ultimate high.\nNotice the blip in a bear market during day 28 (10%) and 35 (7%). I have\nseen this weakness in other chart patterns. Expect the price rise to falter a\nmonth into the trade and be prepared to close out your position then.\nTable 28.6 shows size statistics for the horn pattern.\nHeight.

Prices continue moving higher (perhaps by\n10% or so), then stop. Of course, if your horn appears at the start of an\nuptrend, then prices might well be on their way to a large gain.\nDowntrends. Horns in downtrends are common. On the one hand, if the\ndowntrend is just a retrace of the prevailing uptrend, then refer to the uptrend\nguideline. In such a case, if the horn appears after an extensive advance, then\nthe uptrend may be nearly over. Invest cautiously or look elsewhere.\nOn the other hand, if the stock has been trending downward for a long\ntime (for months anyway), then the end might be in sight. The horn probably\nwill not mark the low exactly, but it should be close. Usually, horns appear a\nmonth or so before or after the actual turning point.\nIf prices are trending down and you see a horn forming, you might wait\nbefore buying the stock, just to be sure prices have really turned around.

At the peak, prices reach a high of 32.63, a gain of 60% in 2\nmonths. With such a sharp gain in so little time, a consolidation or congestion\nregion is likely.

Some break out\nupward and never look back, whereas others begin moving down, falter, and\nthen recover and climb significantly. The latter case, the so-called 5% failures,\nare predominant with horn tops. Prices fail to continue down by more than 5%\nbefore recovering and heading higher. However, 5% failures are rare.\nWhat can be learned from examining the failures? Most horns warn about\na coming decline by forming less than 2 months ahead of schedule. That find-\ning is worth knowing. If a horn fails to call the turn in a stock you own, be alert\nto a possible trend change coming soon.\nYou can improve your investment performance if you consider the over-\nall environment for the stock. Look at the horn top pictured in Figure 29.3.\nAfter trending down for a year, the stock pierced the down-sloping trend line,\nsignaling a trend change, and moved higher. Then the horn top formed.\nIn situations like this, after a long downtrend, a stock usually bounces up,\ncurls around, and retests the low (but not always). So when the horn formed, it\nprobably signaled the price top before the retest. Although not shown in Fig-\nure 29.3, the stock did move lower, but it first bobbled up for a few months (to\n63.50). Ultimately, the stock dipped to 49.13 before recovering.\nBefore you invest in this formation, you have to place emphasis on the\npiercing of the down trend line.

When pullbacks occur,\npostbreakout performance suffers. For example, in a bear market when a pull-\nback happens, the postbreakout decline averages 18%. When a pullback is\nabsent, the decline is significantly larger—25%.\nTable 29.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate low. In\na bear market, for example, 26% of the horn tops reach the ultimate low in the\nfirst week. In a bull market, 24% bottom during week one. At the other end of\nthe scale, about a third of the horns are still searching for the bottom well over\n2 months after the breakout.\nNotice how 14% of the bear market patterns bottom after the first month.\nI have seen this behavior in other chart patterns.

Horns did well when the right spike showed\na wider overlapping trading range than the left spike (an outside week, if you\nignore the center week).

    "text": "Threat assessment. After you have correctly identified the horn, look at\nthe surrounding price pattern. Is the stock trending higher and has it been\nmoving higher for months now? If so, then the horn may signal an approach-\ning top. Sometimes the horn calls the turn exactly while at other times it is off\nby a few months (usually it precedes the turn but sometimes it lags).\nIf the horn appears on a downtrend, that is fine. The formation is simply\nimplying that the trend will continue moving down. However, should the horn\nappear after an extended downtrend, then the possibility of further declines\nmay be in jeopardy. This behavior is especially true if the horn appears after a\nlong downtrend when prices are beginning to move up again (they are retrac-\ning some of their losses). Often the retrace signals a trend change. You will be\nbuying into a situation in which you believe prices will fall and retest the low,\nbut prices will dip slightly and then head higher.\nBe cautious when selling short after a long downtrend, and be especially\ncautious if the downtrend has ended and the horn seems to mark the end of an\nupward retrace. Do not expect prices to fall far. They do occasionally but the\nmajority of the decline has already passed.\nLow volume. Spikes with volume below the 1-month average show\nlower failure rates while improving the average decline in a bull market. That\nis worth considering before you place a trade.\nTrend change. Even if a horn top fails and prices drop by less than 5%,\nthere is a chance that the horn is a premature signal of a bearish trend change.\nTherefore, whenever you see a horn top, be aware that the end of an uptrend\nmay be just a few months away.\nSample Trade\nYou might be saying, “Those bromides are all fine and good, but how do I\nreally trade it?” Consider the situation in Figure 29.4 faced by Sandy. She\nwatched the complex head-and-shoulders formation take shape in a stock she\nowned. Volume on the far left shoulder was higher than during the head, as\nexpected, and volume on the far right shoulder was further diminished. All in\nall, it was setting up to be a dire situation. When she spotted the horn top\nforming on the right shoulder, she knew the end was near.\nTwo weeks after the right horn spike appeared, she sold her holdings in\nthe stock for a tidy profit, but she was not finished. The following week, she\nshorted the stock at 34.25. Her calculations using the measure rule for the\nhead-and-shoulder formation indicated a decline to 16. This was higher than\nthe 12 predicted by the measure rule because she used her sell point instead of\nthe breakout point (which was not reached yet so she had no idea what it was).\nWith the stock selling at 34, a drop to 16 seemed too optimistic. Still, she\nwatched with glee as the stock plummeted. In rapid order it fell to about 25\nbefore meeting support. Sandy scanned the weekly chart looking for support\nSample Trade\n461",

However, the average rise from an island bottom is a disap-\npointing 21% to 23%, and that is well below the 35% to 40% I like to see for\nbullish chart patterns.\nWith these mediocre performers, trading every island that you see is a\nway to drown in losses. You can improve performance by selecting patterns\nwith the proper height and width characteristics for the market you are trad-\ning, as described later in this chapter.\nPullbacks and throwbacks are prevalent, suggesting that the gap after the\nisland completes closes quickly.

I believe that such islands are too difficult\non which to base an effective trading policy.\nPrice trends. Consider Figure 30.2, which shows several island reversals.\nThe first two islands happen as part of a retrace in a downtrend. The small\nisland tops last for about a week before prices resume their downward plunge.\nThe island bottom forms after an extensive decline that sees prices drop\nfrom a high of 36.50 to 12 in less than 5 months. The exhaustion gap occurs on\nvery high volume and prices that day have a very large 3.50 trading range. The\ngap remains open until prices gap upward in late January. Looking at the bot-\ntom formation overall, it looks like a complex head-and-shoulders bottom.\nMarked on the figure are the dual shoulders and duplicate heads. The volume\nfor the head-and-shoulders pattern is what you would expect: highest on the\nleft shoulder, diminished on the head, and quite low on the right shoulder.\nOnly after price gaps upward does volume spike higher for 2 days before recov-\nering and trending downward.\nThe island top on the right of the figure is somewhat difficult to spot\nbecause of the large gap on the left that matches the small one on the right. It\nonly takes a few days for prices to reach their high before easing down. When\nprices gap lower at the end of March, volume does not budge.\nIdentification Guidelines\n467\nTable 30.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nGaps set off both island tops and bottoms and share all or part of\nthe same price level. Most times, prices move away from the gaps\nleaving the island with a clear view of the opposing gap (the left\ngap usually does not close quickly).\nRising trend\nTops have prices that lead up to the left gap and fall away from\nthe right gap.\nFalling trend\nBottoms have prices that lead down to the left gap and rise away\nfrom the right gap.\nVolume\nVolume is usually high on the breakout day (the day prices make\na second gap and form the island) but need not be.\nTime\nThe island can be from one day (a one-day reversal) to several\nmonths long. Some analysts have suggested that islands are quite\nshort, up to a week or two, with relatively flat price zones, but I\nplaced no such restrictions on them.",

When the island top appears, what is there to reverse?\nThe rise from December to mid-February, when prices rise from roughly 55\nto 65, unwinds. Prices move steadily lower at first, then plunge, and end back\nat 56. Beyond that, the prior year’s worth of support at that level is just too\nextensive to allow any further decline.

The island bottom is clearly visible on\nthe chart. The two gaps separate the main body of the island from the main-\nland with plenty of clear ocean. Over the course of the formation, the first gap\nremains open. The second gap closes about a week after prices throw back to\nthe breakout point.

The best performance came from upward\nbreakouts in a bull market and downward breakouts in a bear market, so trade\nthis pattern with the prevailing market trend. Going against the market is like\ntrying to cross a six-lane highway on foot: It is possible but dangerous.\nSince all islands have a gap on the breakout day, I used the intraday low\n(upward breakouts) or intraday high (downward breakouts) the day after the\nbreakout as the breakout price. This delay assumes you bought at the best\nprice the day after the breakout.

    "text": "Days to ultimate high or low. Patterns in a bull market with an upward\nbreakout took more than twice as long as the other combinations to reach the\nultimate high or low. Notice that islands in a bear market with a downward\nbreakout took 34 days compared to 128 in a bull market (up breakout). Since\nboth travel the same distance, 23%, the decline must be dramatically steeper\nthan the rise in a bull market. The implication here is that you should be in\ncash instead of holding stock in a bear market.\nTable 30.3 shows failure rates for islands. For example, 18% of islands in\na bull market with an upward breakout failed to rise more than 5%. Nearly\nhalf, 47%, failed to rise more than 15%. For downward breakouts, read the\ntable the same way. In a bear market, 5% failed to drop more than 5% after the\nbreakout. This is the lowest failure rate of the bunch. Nearly half (47%) failed\nto drop more than 20%.\nIslands in a bear market with downward breakouts do well (have the low-\nest failure rates) until the decline reaches 30%. After that, bull markets, upward\nbreakouts outperform by having the lowest failure rates.\nNotice how the rates progress in each column. For example, in a bear\nmarket with an upward breakout, the failure rate triples from 10% to 29% and\nnearly doubles again to 47% for price moves of 5%, 10%, and 15%. This\ntripling and doubling is common for chart patterns. It suggests that good per-\nformers are hard to find, so you need every break you can get.

Throwbacks and pullbacks occur often for\nislands (between 59% and 75% of the time), suggesting that the second island\ngap closes quickly.

    "text": "The second way to trade islands is wait for the pullback or throwback to\ncomplete. Since pullbacks and throwbacks occur a majority of the time and\nsince island reversals have a low failure rate but poor performance, it is wise to\nwait for the retrace. It usually occurs a week or two after the second gap. If a\npullback or throwback does not occur quickly (in less than a month), then\nmove on to the next trading situation.\nWhen a pullback or throwback occurs, do not invest immediately. Wait\nfor the retrace to complete and for prices to turn around and resume their orig-\ninal direction. Sometimes prices retrace to the formation, then continue mov-\ning in the adverse direction.\nWatch trend lines. In the Focus on Failures section of this chapter I dis-\ncuss the use of the trend line in detail, so there is not much added here. How-\never, both up and down trend lines can show a trend change. Wait for prices\nto close above a down trend line or below an up trend line before pulling the\ntrigger. Many times prices will near the trend line and be repulsed, so you want\nto make sure that the piercing does, indeed, signal a change in trend.\nSample Trade\nConsider the situation faced by Clarence as illustrated in Figure 30.5. He\nwatched the semiconductor company’s stock plummet. During November and\nDecember, the stock formed a long island consolidation. He knew it was not a\nreversal because the two gaps did not line up across from each other. Then\nanother island formed in January to early February.\nSince prices gapped down to the second formation then gapped up away\nfrom it, he knew he was dealing with an island bottom, a better investment\nchoice for performance than an island top. He used the measure rule to gauge\nthe likely price to which the stock would climb. The target represented nearly\na 30% rise in price, large enough to risk a trade.\nBefore he bought the stock, he made a few checks. He saw that the trend\nwas down, as the stock had fallen from a high of 61.13 to the island low of\n17.50. Clarence drew the trend line from the highest high downward and saw\nit go through the right island gap. This was a good sign as prices had moved\nabove the line and closed there. It signaled a possible trend change.\nStill, something did not feel right about the stock. It had made a new low\nand the semiconductor industry as a whole was soft. Did the island bottom\nreally mark a turning point or would the stock simply rise up, spin around, and\nretest the low? He was unsure, so he decided to wait and see if prices threw\nback to the formation. If they threw back then continued higher, he would buy\nthe stock. Three days after the upward breakout, the stock threw back and\nclosed the gap. Now, Clarence knew, all the stock had to do was move higher.\nIt did not.

    "text": "Unaligned gaps. Look for two gaps that do not share the same price. If\nthey do have prices in common, then you are looking at an island reversal. I did\nnot exclude island reversals in my study of islands, but they made up only 18%\nof the samples. An island reversal is also a long island, but a long island is not\nnecessarily an island reversal.\nWide gaps. Small gaps occur frequently, so I looked for gaps at least $1\nwide. This parameter cut the number of islands dramatically, but I still found\nalmost 1,000 in just over 200 stocks.\nShort length. I chose islands that were less than 4 months long. This\ntime frame is longer than a fiscal quarter (3 months) and yet is not too long to\nbe invisible (think of a double bottom with bottoms a year apart . . . how many\ntraders will notice?).\nU-shaped volume. When price gaps, volume usually explodes then\nrecedes. This behavior gives the typical long island a U-shaped volume pattern.\nDo not exclude a long island simply because of the volume pattern, especially\nsince those with dome-shaped volume usually perform better.\nIslands in sequence. When multiple islands appear in the same price\ntrend, they tend to get shorter in length. Figure 31.2 shows an example of this\nbehavior. The first island on the far left (gaps 1 and 2) is wider than the fol-\nlowing one (gaps 2 and 3) and island 3–4 is the shortest of the lot. The 3–4\nisland marks the end of the uptrend.\nBreakout. A breakout occurs on the second gap.\nUsing these identification guidelines, long islands are both plentiful and\nhighly visible on the daily chart.\nFocus on Failures\nFigure 31.3 shows what an island failure looks like. The figure is an example of\nwhat happened to airline stocks when the tragic event of September 11, 2001,\noccurred. The stock market closed for a week and when it reopened, airline\nstocks gapped downward (gap 1). From then on, price continued lower for sev-\neral days, then bounced, and made a slightly lower low. Then the stock recov-\nered and formed a symmetrical triangle.\nIn mid-November, the stock gapped downward (gap 2) and other airline\nstocks also showed weakness on that day, but I do not know why. I do know\nthat it was less than 2 weeks after the release of quarterly numbers. The down-\nward breakout was short-lived as price recovered the next day and continued\nmoving higher.\nThis is a good example of the need for a stop-loss order. A stop would\nhave limited losses if a trader shorted the stock after the downward breakout.\nWithout a stop, a trader would have seen the price climb from a low of 14.85\nto a high of 35.25 less than 4 months later, a rise of 137%.\nThe good news is that losses of this nature, where price moves less than\n5% in the breakout direction (a busted pattern), are rare except in a bull mar-\n484\nIslands, Long",

Upward breakouts have throwbacks more\noften (67% and 74%) than downward breakouts have pullbacks (54% each).\nThe reason for this occurrence is that the downward moves tend to be steeper\nand move farther, making a pullback less likely. For throwbacks, price can col-\nlapse if no one is buying.\nIt takes between 8 and 10 days for the stock to return to the breakout\nprice. When a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suffers. For exam-\nple, islands with throwbacks and upward breakouts in a bull market rise 24%\nafter the breakout, on average. Without a throwback, the rise averages 54%.\nGaps. Do large price gaps mean better performance? Yes, but only dur-\ning a downward breakout. I used the closing price the day before the breakout\n(so I could include the gaps) and checked performance against the median gap\nsize. When the gap was larger than the median, the island tended to perform\nbetter. For the median gap size, I used the smaller of the two island gaps in the\ncomputation.\nTable 31.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow.

Sell\nLine 1 connected the lows and was the new sell signal. When price closed\nbelow the trend line, it was time to sell. All but one of the other airline stocks\npeaked in late February or during March.\nThe general market, using the S&P 500 index as the proxy, also peaked in\nearly March, bumping up against a horizontal trend line set by peaks in\nDecember and January. The peaks formed a right-angled, descending broad-\nening wedge. That mouthful means a pattern with a flat top and down-sloping\ntrend line along the bottoms. The index touched the horizontal trend line in\nearly March and again in mid-March, but seemed reluctant or unable to punch\nthrough. The second touch was higher but by less than a point. The failure to\nmake a significant new high was another warning signal of a trend change.\nLike a bump-and-run reversal top, a chart pattern that shows increasing\nmomentum by steeper sloping trend lines, the party had to end sometime.

    "text": "going. Unlike other chart patterns, I classify MMDs as bearish reversals over\nthe intermediate term. With other patterns, I gauge the term by the time to the\nultimate low, but with MMDs, I am using the pattern length instead.\nI do not show the average decline or the failure rate. The average decline\nmeasures the move from the breakout to the ultimate low, and neither applies\nto this pattern. The failure rate is a measure of how far price moves after the\nbreakout. That also does not apply. \nThe Results Snapshot is self-explanatory with a few exceptions. The\n“Average corrective phase retrace” is how far prices move back up the first leg.\nIn both markets, prices retrace nearly half the first leg move. \nThe second leg is longer than the first one between 35% and 39% of the\ntime on a dollar, not a percentage, basis. On the time scale, about half (53% in\na bull market and 49% in a bear market) of the second legs are longer than the\nfirst ones. \nWhat does this information mean? If you measure the first leg price\ndecline and project it downward from the top of the corrective phase, you will\nhit your target between 35% and 39% of the time. If you take half of the first\nleg move and project downward, you will hit your target between 83% and\n93% of the time. On a percentage basis, however, the first and second leg\ndeclines are about equal.\nA surprising finding that helps with gauging performance is the retrace\namount of the corrective phase. Large retraces, over 62%, are more likely to be\nfollowed by a second leg decline that matches or exceeds the first leg decline.\nSmall retraces (less than 38% of the first leg move) show a larger likelihood of\nthe second leg being shorter than the first. Also, the decline is steeper and price\ntravels farther in a bear market than in a bull market. That should not be a sur-\nprise because MMDs are a bearish chart pattern.

The decline\nfrom the high (point A) to the start of the retrace (point C) is called the first leg.\nThe retrace is commonly referred to as the corrective phase and the remaining\ndecline to the low is called the second leg. The first and second legs are nearly\nthe same size, but their behavior is described in more detail later in the Statis-\ntics section.\nThe corrective phase is simply an upward retrace of the downtrend.

Paying\nattention might save you some big bucks.\nReturning to Figure 32.1, you can see the two legs following a trend line\nthat has nearly the same slope.

Although the example in\nFigure 32.1 is weak on the first leg, you can see how the second leg follows a\ntop trend line, connecting points D and E and extending down.\nLastly, the three points marked A, B, and C mark another measured move\ndown.

The first leg occurs as prices reach a new high and a trend\nchange begins. Prices decline, leaving a price peak on the chart.

    "text": "Second leg. When the second leg begins, the downturn resumes. Prices\nusually follow the slope set by the first leg but this varies from formation to for-\nmation. Of course, the two legs will not share the same trend line since the cor-\nrective phase offsets them. Even so, the second leg usually fits inside its own\ntrend channel as prices decline in a straight-line fashion. The second leg\ndecline approximates the price decline set by the first leg and the time it took\nto accomplish it.\nAvoid. There are several guidelines that you should follow when search-\ning for the measured move down. Avoid formations that show a rounded first\nleg, where prices move lower but curve around in a sort of rounding turn, scal-\nlop, or saucer. The trend should be a straight-line decline.\nDuring the corrective phase, prices should not rebound (or come close) to\nthe high set by the first leg. If prices near or rise above the first leg high, then\navoid the formation.\nWatch for consecutive measured moves in a declining price trend. The\ndowntrend eventually will end, so it is best to trade on the first or second mea-\nsured move and avoid the rest.\nOccasionally, the prevailing price trend will be horizontal. Prices rise up\nand reach a high then begin down in the first leg. When prices return to the\nbase, they bounce. This bounce, wrongly interpreted as the corrective phase of\na measured move down, is really a minor high in a consolidation trend. Prices\nreturn to the base and may bounce several more times before beginning a sus-\ntained move upward. The overall picture looks like a horizontal saw-tooth for-\nmation. Avoid measured moves that spring from a horizontal trend.\nThe last caveat is to consider the measure rule. I discuss the measure rule\nin the Trading Tactics section of this chapter, but the measure rule says the\nIdentification Guidelines\n499\nTable 32.1\nIdentification Characteristics \nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nFirst leg\nUsually begins from a new high. Prices decline rapidly in a straight-\nline fashion. Avoid declines that curve (they are rounding turns,\nscallops, or saucers).\nCorrective phase\nPrices can move horizontally but usually rise and recover from 38%\nto 62% of the prior decline before resuming the downtrend. If the\ncorrective phase nears or rises above the first leg high, look\nelsewhere.\nSecond leg\nThe slope of the first leg down trend line often carries onto this leg.\nBoth legs usually fit inside their own trend channels.\nAvoid\nFor cascading measured moves, use the first retrace and not later\nones as they get progressively closer to the end of the trend. Avoid\nhorizontal, saw-tooth consolidation regions and measured moves\nthat rise from a flat base. Make sure the measure rule does not\npredict prices will fall below zero.",

Examples of these idiosyncrasies follow in the Focus on Fail-\nures section.\nFigure 32.2 shows two examples of the measured move down formation.\nThe first one, marked by points A, B, C, and D, begins after a long price rise.

In the second leg, prices\nmove below the low (point B) and continue lower to point D. Then it is over.\nThe second leg is steeper than the first leg and covers the ground in about\nhalf the time (36 days versus 19 days).

    "text": "Focus on Failures\nThere are a number of identification mistakes that I want to point out. Figure\n32.3 shows the first one. The semiconductor maker’s stock reaches a high,\nalong with a host of other chip makers’ stocks, in the summer and fall of 1995.\nThe stock forms a head-and-shoulders top in August and September before\nburning out. In a near straight-line run, the stock tumbles from a high of 33.50\nto a low of 9.13.\nIf this decline marks the first leg of a measured move down, how far will\nprices fall in the second leg? That depends on how far up the corrective phase\nbrings prices. The corrective phase rises to a high of 15.25. I discuss the mea-\nsure rule later, but it says the second leg approximates the price decline of the\nfirst leg. If we run through the computations, we discover that the predicted\ndecline is minus 9.13. Even if the company were to declare bankruptcy, its\nstock price would never go negative. \nAnother key to this failure is the size of the corrective phase. Usually,\nprices recover 38% to 62% of the first leg decline, but this one does not come\nclose (about a 25% retrace). With larger price declines, the corrective phase is\nproportionally larger too.

    "text": "Figure 32.4 shows another situation: the flat base problem. Prices are\nessentially flat from the start of February. By that I mean the minor lows all\nshare the same value—about 40. When prices move up in August and reach a\nminor high in September, it is nothing unusual. Although the prior minor\nhighs do not ascend to this height, there is no reason to suspect that a measured\nmove will follow.\nWhen prices decline to the base at 40 and bounce, a naive investor might\nthink a measured move down is forming. The corrective phase in late October\nand early November sees prices rebound far up the first leg before curling over\nand heading down. If the investor sells short at this point, it will be a costly mis-\ntake. Prices quickly skyrocket to 60 by May from the second leg low of 44.88.\nWhy does this formation fail? The strong support level at 40 curtails any mean-\ningful decline below that point. In other words, there is nothing to reverse.\nFigure 32.5 shows the last failure, a case of mistaken identity. After a\nlong, extended rise, a retrace can be expected, maybe even a trend change that\ntakes prices drastically lower. When prices turn down in early January, a\ndecline is long overdue. If you connect the minor lows in the uptrend, you dis-\ncover that prices pierce the up trend line in mid-December. This piercing sup-\nports the theory that the trend is changing. It is not conclusive, but it does tilt\nthe scales in that direction. Throughout the month of December prices essen-\ntially move horizontally before perking up and making a new high just before\nprices plummet.

First, the MMD can form at the end of a rising\nprice trend or, second, it could start a new trend after the MMD completes. I\nconsider both movements as being valid price reversals. \nFor continuations, the MMD forms in an established declining price\ntrend.

Once you suspect that a measured move down is forming,\nprobably just after the corrective phase completes and prices start down, short\nthe stock. Use the measure rule to predict the price target, but expect prices to\ncome up short.

For a more conser-\nvative target, follow the measure rule using one-half of the first leg height.\nPrices reach the new target 83% of the time. For example, one-half of the first\nleg height in Figure 32.6 is 5.44. Subtracting this value from the corrective\nphase high gives a closer target of 42.31.\nClose out.

After a measured move down completes, the cor-\nrective phase often spells a resistance zone for future moves. Prices pause on\nthe approach to the corrective phase low and at the high. Figure 32.6 has these\nzones labeled. If you are nimble, you can anticipate this rise and trade long\nonce the measured move down completes. Sell if prices run into trouble dur-\ning the corrective phase and begin heading lower. In a bull market you can\ngenerally expect prices to eventually push through the corrective phase resis-\ntance and move up to the old high, but that could take months or years.\nSample Trade\nPeople are nasty; just ask Eddy. He is an airline reservation agent. Between the\ncompany monitoring his phone calls to be sure he peddles a car and hotel\nwhen appropriate and the people screaming at him from the other end of the\nphone, it is a tough living. There is nothing he can do about equipment prob-\nlems or the weather, but people do not seem to care. Even the full moon gets\ninto the act as that is when the crazies call.\nWhat he would really like to do is invest in the stock market. He does it\nnow but to a limited extent because of a cash-flow problem. Fortunately, with\na few clicks of his computer mouse he can flip to the Internet and monitor his\nlatest stock pick when he is not busy.\nThat is how he uncovered the situation shown in Figure 32.6. He\nwatched the stock climb from a low of about 10 in June 1994 to a high of 53.63\nin October 1995. Every so often, he would draw trend lines along the bottoms\nof the minor lows and notice how the upward trend seemed to be accelerating\n(the trend lines grew steeper over time).\nSince he knew this could not last, he was ready for a trend change, which\noccurred on November 14 when prices pierced the trend line, moving down.\n508\nMeasured Move Down",

Then, they dropped sharply, tumbling $3 in one session.\nWhen prices fell, they pierced a small up trend line, drawn along the bot-\ntoms of the climb from points B to C.

The chart pattern was making a mea-\nsured move down, so he shorted the stock that day and received a fill at 42.\nHe used the measure rule to compute the predicted price move and\nplaced an order with his broker to cover the short at the predicted price\n(36.88).

In Figure 33.1, the corrective phase\nbegins in late January and extends through most of February. Prices retrace\n55% of the first leg price move. Once the correction completes, prices climb\neven more rapidly during the second leg. You can see that prices bow upward\ninstead of touching the trend line in a sort of rounding-over maneuver before\ntopping out in June. The rise constitutes what is commonly called the second\nleg. It is the rise from the corrective phase to the end of the formation.\nOnce the formation completes, prices sometimes drop back to the level of\nthe corrective phase or lower. In this example, you can see that prices dropped\nto just below the top of the corrective phase (in July) before recovering.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 33.1 lists the identification characteristics for this formation.\nDownward trend. The chart pattern usually, but not always, begins\nwhen prices bottom out after a downtrend. The declining price trend can\nrange all over the scale. In Figure 33.1, for example, prices reach the Novem-\nber lows after shooting up in a bull run that starts in December 1991 and ends\n2 months later. Then prices meander—essentially moving horizontally with a\nslight downward bend. Six months later, they decline from a high of about\n18.25 to a low of 14.75.\n512\nMeasured Move Up\nTable 33.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nDownward trend\nA downward price trend that lasts from a few weeks to over a year\nusually precedes the start of the formation.

The retrace is usually proportional\nto the first leg rise: Large retraces follow large rises. Sometimes the\ncorrective phase resembles a saw-tooth pattern (a few sharp rises\nand declines in a row) before prices break away and zoom\nupward. This saw-tooth pattern usually associates with a long\nprice climb leading to the formation.\nSecond leg\nPrices rise, loosely following the slope of the trend line set by the\nfirst leg.

The figure shows that the first leg has a slight bow\nto it in the early part of the rise. However, you can extend the up trend line and\ndraw a parallel one connecting the minor highs and see that the first leg fits\ninside a trend channel. The second leg does even better. The bottom trend line\ntouches several places and a parallel top trend line (not shown for clarity) also\nintersects the minor highs nicely.\nCorrective phase. In this case, a falling wedge composes the corrective\nphase. This formation makes trading the measured move easy since it predicts\na price rise. Once prices break out from the wedge, buy into the stock and ride\nthe upward move.

This is a\nwarning sign. There is a common Street axiom that says rising prices need high\nvolume but falling prices can decline on their own weight. This formation appears\nto be an example of that axiom. Since there is little upward buying pressure to\npush prices higher, momentum fades out just below the prior top and then prices\ntumble. The resulting decline sees prices fall below the start of the first leg.\nBefore we move on to statistics, I want to alert you to some identification\nproblems. When prices rise steadily for a long time, say over a year or more,\nthen begin a MMU, the corrective phase might be excessively choppy. I men-\ntioned this behavior in the Identification Guidelines section and in Table 33.1,\nbut it is something to keep in mind.\nAlso, do not be too quick to buy into the situation. Remember that the\ncorrective phase should be proportional to the first leg rise. By that I mean\nprices should fall anywhere from 40% to 60% of the first leg move before\nbeginning the second leg. If prices only fall 15% before turning up, then it\nmight be a false breakout.\nSometimes prior peaks are a key to how far prices retrace. These minor\nhighs are often places of support. When prices decline to that level, they pause\nand move horizontally for a time before continuing down or rebounding. Vol-\nume is often a key to the level of support you can expect from these types of sit-\nuations. A prior peak with high turnover will give more support to a stock on\nits way down. That is not to say that the stock will not burn through the sup-\nport, just that it might take more of a push to fall off the cliff.\nStatistics\nThe tables in this section differ from those given in other chapters because of\nthe uniqueness of this chart pattern. Many of the statistics provided elsewhere\ndo not apply because there is no breakout and no ultimate low or high. Table\n33.2 shows general statistics for MMUs.\nNumber of formations. I found 810 MMUs in the stocks I looked at.\nSince the pattern was so plentiful, I did not search all of the stocks in my data-\nbase.

Another 19% to\n31% of the time, prices continue moving down but stop before the MMU low.\nThe remaining 15% to 16% of the time, prices continue tumbling.\nCombining the numbers, between 54% and 64% of the time, price will\nnot drop below the corrective phase. Thus, you could use the bottom of the\ncorrective phase as a stop loss price. That would allow price to resume its climb\nabout half the time. The other half of the time, the stop will protect you from\na more massive loss. The bad news is that a decline to the corrective phase may\nmean a large profit giveback.\nIf you are a swing trader, you might sell as price nears the target (the sec-\nond leg high) and buy back after it rebounds in the corrective phase. Holding\nonto the stock after the MMU completes means you are willing to suffer\nthrough the average 26% to 27% price decline (see “Change after trend ends”\nin Table 33.2).\nTrading Tactics\nTable 33.5 shows trading tactics for measured move up formations.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule predicts the level to which prices will\nrise. To estimate the target price, compute the height of the first leg. I use the\nmeasured move up formation shown in Figure 33.4 as an example. Locate the\nhighest high in the first leg. Usually this is somewhere near the beginning of\nthe corrective phase, and point A indicates this in the figure. From this value\n(21.13), subtract the lowest low (14.13) in the first leg, shown as point B. The\ndifference (7) is the height of the first leg. Add it to point C (18.38)—or the\nlowest low in the corrective phase—to arrive at the target price. In this case,\nthe target price is 25.38. Prices reach the target just 10 trading days after the\ncorrective phase ends.\nUsing the full length of first leg projected upward works 45% of the time\nin a bull market and 56% of the time in a bear market. A better method is to\nuse half the first leg move. That would work 85% of the time in a bull market\nand 99.6% of the time in a bear market. Do not let the bear market number\nfool you. Your trade may be the exception.\n518\nMeasured Move Up\nTable 33.4\nAfter Pattern Ends\nDescription\nBull Market\nBear Market\nPrice stops above corrective phase\n19%\n24%\nPrice stops within corrective phase\n35%\n40%\nPrice stops below corrective phase but \nabove MMU low\n31%\n19%\nPrice stops below MMU low\n15%\n16%",

Whatever the\ncase, be aware that if you do not sell near the target price and decide to hold on,\nyou might lose all your gains.\nSample Trade\nMichelle is an engineer. Over the years, she has developed a thick skin to take\nthe ribbing from her college colleagues in a male-dominated profession. Even\nwhen she ventured into the professional environment after college, the ribbing\ncontinued. Make no mistake: She is pretty and they just wanted her attention.\nI saw this firsthand when I stopped by her office with a question. She was not\nthere at the time, but her desk blotter had the scribblings of love notes from\ndozens of men. Of course, I added my own, but I digress.\nIf you were to give a Rubic’s cube to Michelle, she would not necessarily\nsolve it. First, she would want to take it apart to see how it is constructed. This\ninquisitiveness coupled with her ability to solve tough problems in a unique\nway makes her special even among engineers. She is also an investor with the\nsame qualities.\nMichelle had a unique way to take advantage of the situation shown in\nFigure 33.4. She already owned the stock but believed it was running out of\nsteam. During the prior November to February period (not shown), she saw\nthe stock form a double top. Prices declined from a high of 24.13 to the low of\n14.13 at the start of the measured move.\nUnfortunately, as a novice investor, she was unable to pull the trigger and\nsell it after prices confirmed the double top. She rode the decline down to the\nlow and saw 41% of her gains evaporate. When the stock began moving up, she\nbreathed easier. Still, she vowed to do better the next time. As the stock started\nits climb, she saw the increase in volume. The increase meant that the run\nwould be an extended one, as there seemed to be enough enthusiasm to send\nprices higher.\nAll bull runs must pause now and again and this situation was no differ-\nent. Michelle saw the stock pause and consolidate for nearly a month during\nJuly. She looked back at the chart and noticed that the stock had reached a zone\nof resistance where there were several old highs that stalled prices near the 21\n520\nMeasured Move Up",

Michelle calculated that the stock would rise to 25.38, a new yearly high.\nShe suspected that the stock might find resistance at the old highs of 24, and\nthat is exactly what happened. A symmetrical triangle formed in the stock. The\nformation obeyed the rules for symmetrical triangles, lower highs and higher\nlows with a receding volume pattern, and she was confident that she had cor-\nrectly identified it.\nSince there was no way to tell which direction the stock would break out\nof the triangle, she sat tight. Then prices gapped out the top. Was the gap a\nbreakaway gap or an exhaustion gap? She reasoned that since the gap appeared\njust after a region of consolidation, it was most likely a breakaway gap, so prices\nwould continue rising, but how far? She hoped the triangle represented the\nhalfway mark of an up move. She knew that symmetrical triangle formations\nsometimes act like half-staff formations, so she expected a climb to 28 (see the\nmeasure rule for symmetrical triangles). To her it sounded like a long shot, but\none worth waiting for. Her calculated price target of 25.38 was met the day\nprices jumped out of the triangle.\nAbout a week after prices left the triangle, they reached a new high and\nthen fell back. When price closed the gap in the first part of September, she\ndecided to sell her holdings. Fortunately, the next day prices zoomed upward\nand she was able to sell her shares at 24.50, near the daily high of 25.13. After\nthat, the stock tumbled back to the middle of the corrective phase, right in the\ncenter of the support zone. Then, the stock recovered. As the stock climbed and\nposted a new high, she wondered if she had sold too soon. She felt better after\nreviewing the chart 6 months later and seeing prices hovering in the $15 range.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select MMUs that\noutperform. Consult the associated table for more information.\n• Review the identification guidelines for correct selection—Table 33.1.\n• On a percentage basis, the second leg is about two-thirds the length of\nthe first leg (bull market). In a bear market, the second leg is margin-\nally shorter (by four percentage points)—Table 33.2.\n• In a bull market, the average length of the first leg is 11% shorter than\nis the second on a dollar basis. In a bear market, the second leg is 8%\nlonger—Table 33.2.\n• Select patterns with a rising volume trend—Table 33.3.\n• After the MMU ends, prices stop declining above or within the cor-\nrective phase between 54% to 64% of the time—Table 33.4.\nFor Best Performance\n521",

Pennants are for short-term\n(swing) traders, not for buy-and-hold investors.\nMeasure rule. Use the measure rule to help predict a price target. Fig-\nure 34.5 shows an example. The trend starts at point A and climbs to the pen-\nnant. Take the difference between the top (intraday high) of the pennant at its\nstart (B at 10.69) and the trend start low (point A, at 7.50) to get the trend\nheight of 3.19. Add this value to the intraday low at the pennant end (point C\nat 11.44, the day before the breakout) to get the price target (14.63). Price\nclimbs to the target 3 days after the breakout.\nWarning: This method works between half (bear markets) and two-thirds\nof the time (bull markets), so be conservative in your estimate.\nWait for breakout. Since pennants do reverse on occasion, it is best to\nwait for the breakout. A breakout occurs when price closes outside the pennant\nboundary. Only then should you take a position in the stock. Do not procras-\ntinate, as delays will be costly.\nClose out the trade. Price should move in the direction of the prevail-\ning price trend, usually following a slope similar to that before the pennant.\nWhen price falters (pauses), sell.\nSample Trade\nConsider the situation shown in Figure 34.5. The pennant obeys the identifi-\ncation guidelines shown in Table 34.1. The pennant looks odd because price\ntrends upward in the pennant instead of declining. In that regard, the pennant\nis unusual, but it is still a pennant.\nSample Trade\n533\nTable 34.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nCalculate the price difference between the start of the trend and the\npennant.

    "text": "A key to this trade is the flat base. It started in early 1999 and a portion of\nit appears in the figure. Many technical traders look for this type of situation—\na heavy volume breakout after a long horizontal move. They say that the\nlonger the base, the more powerful the move up. Based on this example alone,\nI would have to agree.\nYou can see how price punched through the base’s ceiling on high volume\nthen coasted higher, forming the pennant. Once price shot out the top (a close\noutside the pennant trend line), the stage was set for a trade.\nMany technical traders would have entered this trade on the breakout\nfrom the base (when price closed above the base’s top), allowing them to profit\non the ride up. Using the pennant as a measure rule sell signal would be a\nbonus.\nSuppose you saw the pennant form and watched price break out. The\nnext day, you would buy at the market open, filled at 12.53, which was also the\nintraday low.\nPrice rises toward the measure rule target of 14.63. Stay in the trade as\nprice makes higher highs. You can place an order to sell near the target so the\nmarket will take you out automatically. That order usually results in selling\nnear a minor high and gives you a higher profit than trying to time it yourself.\nIn this case, since price was trending up, stay in the trade.

    "text": "After researching the performance of horn tops and bottoms, the natural thing\nto consider is removing the intervening week and testing the pattern again.\nThat is where the pipe formation comes from. Pipe bottoms are an exciting\ndiscovery with a low failure rate (5%) and a high average rise (45%) in a bull\nmarket.\nI conducted an in-depth study of pipe bottoms on daily price charts and\ncame up disappointed. The statistics show that daily pipes have a failure rate of\n18% with an average gain of 33%. Almost half the formations (45%) have\ngains less than 20%. However, there are a number of large gains; almost a\nquarter of the formations (23%) have gains over 50%.\nI began to believe that an investor trading daily pipes would either pick a\nformation that fails or one that has such a small gain as to be unprofitable, so I\ndiscarded the research and looked at the weekly chart. As you can see from the\npreceding numbers, the performance is quite good. Not only is this formation\nworth exploring further, it just might be an outstanding performer worth\nadding to your technical toolbox.\nThe only surprise that needs explaining is inside and outside weeks. An\ninside week is one in which the right spike’s trading range is inside the trading\nrange of the prior week. An outside week is the reverse, with a higher high and\nlower low than the prior week. Pipes that are inside weeks perform better than\noutside weeks.\nTour\nFigure 35.1 shows a pipe formation and the price appreciation that results. The\nchart is on the weekly scale and you can see that prices begin dropping in mid-\nOctober, 1993, down to the pipe pattern. Volume picks up during the left pipe\nspike and is even higher the following week. The two downward price spikes,\nof almost equal length and overlapping, mark a turning point, a signal that the\ndecline is over.\nFrom the low, prices move up smartly and reach a new high in early\nNovember, a climb of almost 120% in just 9 months. For this formation, such\nlarge gains are not unusual. Almost 20% of the pipes in a bull market have\ngains over 90%.\nIdentification Guidelines\nHow do you correctly identify pipe bottoms? Table 35.1 outlines the identifi-\ncation characteristics. Although there are a number of guidelines to consider,\nthey are really quite obvious. Consider the pipe shown in Figure 35.2. \nIdentification Guidelines\n537",

Two adjacent downward price spikes\ncompose the pipe bottom, and it looks like two parallel lines on the chart.\nLarge spikes. The pipe spikes should appear as a large price drop and\nwide price range for 2 weeks in a row. The week before and after the pipe\nshould have low prices near the top of the pipe. This characteristic makes the\npipe stand out on the price chart as an easily recognizable formation. For exam-\nple, the pipe shown in Figure 35.2 has a prior week low of 11.63, somewhat near\nthe left pipe high of 12.56 (certainly well above the low of 10.31). The right side\ndoes even better.

The pipe must be unusual enough to jump out of the\nprice chart. Typically, pipes form at the end of a decline and mark the turning\npoint, such as that shown in Figures 35.1 and 35.2. Less frequently, pipes act\nas a consolidation of the upward trend.

After the pipes complete,\nprices should move up smartly, but they head lower instead. Why? Volume on\nthe left spike of both pipes is below the monthly average. However, the right\nside shows higher than average volume in both formations. Still, the volume\npattern is unconvincing, as it usually appears most brisk at pipe bottoms. As a\ncontrast, look at the pipe on the far left side of the chart. Both spikes show vol-\nume that is well above average.\nAnother clue to the failures lies buried in the guidelines outlined in Table\n35.1. Prices should drop unusually far during the 2 weeks, more than most down-\nward price thrusts during the year. As you look at the chart, you can see several\ndownward, 1-week spikes (December and February, for example) that nearly\nequal the length of the two pipe formations. The entire chart seems filled with\nragged price spikes of varying lengths. For this reason, you should be skeptical\nof investing in these two pipes.\nThe pipe failures shown in Figure 35.3 are not pipes at all because price\ndoes not close above the highest high in the pattern. Thus, a trader would not\ntrade these patterns.\nIncidentally, before we leave Figure 35.3, it is a good time to illustrate a\nsomewhat common feature of pipes. Since pipes often appear at the end of a\ndownward price trend, prices sometimes rise up, loop around, and retest the\nlow. The pipe in early December 1991 is an example. Prices bounce upward,\nround over, and fall back on themselves, forming a new low at 98.13. The\nretest of the original low completes in late March.\nPipe bottoms exhibit support at their lows. Rarely do prices drop more\nthan a half a point or so below the pipe low before recovering and beginning\nan extended upward trend. The half point is not an absolute rule as it depends\non the price of the stock (the one shown in the chart is a $100 stock and it\ndrops $1 below the prior low).\nSo even though you may buy into a stock above the top of the pipe and\nwatch prices fall, hold on.\nStatistics\nTable 35.2 shows general statistics for pipes.\nNumber of formations. Pipes are everywhere. I needed only 200 stocks in\na bull market (mid-1991 to mid-1996) to find almost 1,000 patterns. For the bear\nmarket, I used about 220 stocks bracketing the bear market from 2000 to 2003.\nReversal or continuation. Pipes bottoms are, by definition, reversals of\nthe downward price trend because price breaks out upward after the pattern.\nAverage rise. The average rise in a bull market is a huge 45%! In a bear\nmarket, the pattern performs less well, rising an average of 32%. Trade this\npattern in a bull market for the best results.\nStatistics\n541",

Pipes with equal prices may outperform,\nbut they happen infrequently, so look for a lower left spike instead.\nInside/outside week. In both bull and bear markets, pipes that are inside\nweeks performed better than do those that were outside weeks.

Again, I allowed no price ties.\nPipes as outside weeks hurt performance and inside weeks improve it.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 35.9 lists pipe trading tactics. Perhaps the most critical feature of a pipe\nbottom is what happens in the third week. While you can easily spot two adja-\ncent downward price spikes, toss the formation aside if prices do not rise the\nthird week. The third week, the week following the second pipe spike, should\nleave a well-defined dual spike visible on the price chart.

Had this downward price spike been alone, it might have signaled a\none-day reversal (one-week reversal really, since we are on the weekly scale).\nHowever, another downward spike appeared the following week. Prices did\nnot drop to the low of the prior week (38.38) but they came close at 38.63. The\ndual spikes were long enough to set them apart from the surrounding price\naction, certainly longer than the brief, 1-week, dip in mid-March.

He\nsaw prices crumble again and hoped that it was only a retest of the low and not\nthe start of a new downward breakout.\nDuring late November, prices reached a low of 38.63, tying one of the pipe\nlows. Then prices moved modestly higher. Peter decided to double his position\nand bought more stock. In early February, prices broke out of their congestion\nzone and zoomed higher. From that point on, there was no looking back.\nPrices continued rising in an almost straight-line bead until April 1996.\nThen, after setting a new high (80.38), prices backtracked. Expecting a retrace\nin an uptrend, Peter held onto his shares. He watched the shares sink and\nwhen they reached 72, he gave up and sold. Prices dipped to 69.95 before\nbeginning upward again. Peter sold too soon (as it continued moving substan-\ntially higher).

Always wait for price to confirm the pattern; that is, price\nmust close below the lowest low in the pipe before the pattern becomes a true\npipe. Never trade an unconfirmed pipe.\nFocus on Failures\nThe vast majority of failures occur when prices decline by less than 5% before\nresuming their upward trend. These 5% failures do not happen that often, but\ntheir occurrence is significant enough to warrant a review of the situation.\nMany failures occur when prices are trending up. The uptrend ranges\nfrom several months to over a year, and the pipes seem to signal a coming trend\nchange. Sometimes they do and prices drop, but by less than 5%. At other\ntimes, the drop is more severe, but it is in the future, from 2 to 5 or more\nmonths ahead. In between the pipe and the drop, there are higher prices.\nSprinkled among the uptrend failures are those related to downtrends.\nPipes usually appear at the end of a long downtrend or shortly after the trend\nchanges and begins moving up.

For many chart for-\nmations, even those that have a measure rule to predict what the eventual price\nwill be, there is still one overriding rule: There must be something to reverse.\nYou can see that the consolidation region narrows over time, reminiscent\nof a long, symmetrical triangle. Even the volume pattern supports the forma-\ntion by receding most of the way along the chart pattern. Since the boundaries\nof a symmetrical triangle mark lines of support and resistance, the possible\ndecline from the pipe base to the triangle boundary is just 5%, not a very com-\npelling investment. In essence, there just is not much of a climb to reverse.\nHowever, in all fairness, if the pipe correctly predicted a downward break-\nout from the triangle, I would be telling you a different story. Since it is diffi-\ncult or impossible to predict the breakout direction from a symmetrical\ntriangle, it is best to wait for the actual breakout. If investors waited for prices\nto close below the pipe, they could have saved themselves from a loss. As it is,\nthe pipe shown in Figure 36.3 is a failure of prices to decline.

In reality, however, price will trend downward\nleading to the pipe and continue moving down after the pipe. Thus, you will\noften find that it acts as a continuation of the downward price trend.\nConfused? How about this: The pattern acts as a minor 4-week reversal\nin the midst of a longer-term trend. If the price trend is down, expect it to con-\ntinue moving down. To add fuel to the confusion, I often see pipes at the sum-\nmit of uptrends.\nAverage decline.

Use the measure rule for pipes to find a price target.\nCompute the formation height by subtracting the lowest low from the highest\nhigh in the pipe. Subtract the result from the breakout price (the lowest low)\nto get a target. In a bull market, this method works 70% of the time and in a\nbear market, it works 68% of the time.\nDowntrends. The performance of pipes depends on the prevailing trend.\nFor larger percentage losses, look for pipes that appear in downtrends. Pipes\nwill usually appear in an upward retrace of a long-term decline. Try to find\npipes where the decline is evident but just starting.\nWatch for trend end. What you do not want to do is invest near the end\nof a downtrend. Of course, trying to determine when a trend will end is some-\nthing of an art. However, if the stock has been trending down for many months\n(such as a year or more), then you should probably look elsewhere.\nLong-term uptrends. In long-term uptrends, the pipe might signal the\nend of a trend. Sometimes it is premature by a few months, so do not be in too\nmuch of a rush to sell the stock short. At other times, a review of the sur-\nrounding price patterns might be rewarding.

Companies using the\ncheap steel thought the decline was great but the steel companies did not agree.\nThat is why they started jumping up and down on their favorite politicians.\nWhen Johnny saw the situation depicted in Figure 36.4, he formed a\nunique plan to profit from the pipe top.

As shown in Figure 37.1, I ignore the few days just before the formation\nstarts for those patterns with overshoot, choosing to use the prevailing longer\ntrend instead.\nHorizontal trend lines. Prices bounce between two levels, setting up a\nsupport zone at the bottom and a line of resistance at the top. If you connect\nthe minor highs with a trend line, it should be horizontal or nearly so. A simi-\nlar line drawn below the bottoms forms a parallel trend line. The two trend\nlines bound the price action. Occasionally, one of the lines will not be exactly\nhorizontal or will break near the end, which is fine as long as the slope is not\ntoo steep to disturb the overall picture.\nTouches. At least two touches of each trend line are required for a valid\nrectangle. Figure 37.2 shows three alternating touches. Touches need not\nalternate, but you should have at least two clearly defined minor highs and two\nminor lows coming close to or touching the trend lines.

    "text": "Notice how quickly the failure rates climb. For example, 16% of the rec-\ntangles in a bull market with downward breakouts fail to drop more than 5%.\nThis statistic skyrockets to 41% failing to drop more than 10%, and 60% drop\nless than 15%!\nAlso, notice that the lowest failure rates accompany breakout directions\nthat are in line with the general market—bull market, upward breakouts and\nbear market, downward breakouts. The countertrend rectangles (bear/up,\nbull/down) have higher failure rates.\nHere is another way to use the table. Suppose you have a rectangle with\na breakout price of 10 and it is 2.50 tall. The measure rule (discussed later in\nthe chapter) suggests a rise to 12.50 after an upward breakout. That is a 25%\nmove. How likely is that in a bear market? Answer: 64% will fail to rise that far.\nTable 37.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\nFormation end to breakout. The move from the rectangle end to the\nbreakout is a quick one, averaging between 3 and 4 days.\nYearly position.

Think about that information before you buy\na rectangle in a stock making new lows. The breakout may be downward,\nemphasizing that bottom fishing (buying stocks making new lows because you\nthink they are poised to recover) is a difficult skill to master.\nYearly position, performance. Mapping performance over the yearly\nprice range gives mixed results because of the low sample counts.

    "text": "As Table 37.2 predicted (see “Days to ultimate high or low”), RBs in a\nbear market with a downward breakout show the quickest decline, with 55%\nreaching the ultimate low in less than 3 weeks. At the other end of the scale,\n14% are still searching for the ultimate low after 70 days.\nWhat do the numbers mean? Table 37.5 shows how likely your rectangle\nwill top/bottom out over time. Rectangles with upward breakouts will take\nlonger to reach the ultimate high than those with downward breakouts. In a\nbear market, RBs show strength at day 56, so if you short a stock, you may need\nto close out your position in weeks 7 to 9.\nTable 37.6 shows statistics related to size.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform better than short ones. For example, tall\nrectangles in bull markets with upward breakouts rise 66% after the breakout.\nRectangles shorter than the median show postbreakout rises of just 34%.\nWidth. Usually, wide patterns perform better than narrow ones, but the\ndifference is slight. The exception is for rectangles in bear markets with\nupward breakouts. Narrow rectangles show rises of 25% and wide ones rise\n24% after the breakout. I used the median width as the separator between nar-\nrow and wide.\nAverage formation length. The average rectangle length was about 78\ndays except for those in a bear market with a downward breakout. They aver-\naged 58 days long. I set a minimum length of about 2 weeks because short rec-\ntangles are better classified as flags.\nHeight and width combinations. Looking at the combination of height\nand width, you would expect patterns both tall and wide to perform best\nbecause those traits do well individually. Table 37.6 shows that is indeed the\ncase if you overlook the low sample count results (the 85% rise for rectangles\nin bull markets, upward breakouts used 18 samples, and the 41% rise in bear\nmarkets, upward breakouts had 9 samples).\nTable 37.7 shows volume-related statistics.\n572\nRectangle Bottoms\nTable 37.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High or Low\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market, \nup breakout\n18%\n13%\n0%\n5%\n4%\n4%\n5%\n7%\n5%\n5%\n33%\nBull market, \nup breakout\n12%\n6%\n2%\n2%\n2%\n1%\n2%\n3%\n3%\n3%\n63%\nBear market, \ndown \nbreakout\n24%\n18%\n13%\n8%\n5%\n5%\n4%\n7%\n1%\n2%\n14%\nBull market, \ndown \nbreakout\n32%\n10%\n12%\n7%\n9%\n3%\n2%\n2%\n3%\n1%\n18%",

    "text": "Trading Tactics\nTable 37.9 lists trading tactics for rectangle bottoms.\nMeasure rule. The first tactic is to determine the predicted price target\nusing the measure rule. The rule first finds the height of the formation by sub-\ntracting the lowest low from the highest high. In essence, just subtract the\nvalue of the two trend lines from each other. Figure 37.4 shows an example of\nthis. The top trend line is at 12.44 and the bottom one is at 11. The difference,\n1.44, is the formation height. Add the height to the value of the top trend line\nto get the upward breakout target (13.88) and subtract it from the value of the\nlower trend line to get the downward breakout target (9.56). Some analysts\nsuggest measuring the length (not the height) of the rectangle, flipping it ver-\ntically, and adding or subtracting it from the top or bottom trend line to get the\nmaximum price move (for upward and downward breakouts, respectively).\nThis approach sounds a bit far-fetched, but it is a handy guideline. Use it with\ncaution as I have not verified how well it works.\nThe measure rule (vertical measure) works between 50% and 66% of the\ntime for downward breakouts and between 64% and 85% of the time for\nupward breakouts.\n576\nRectangle Bottoms\nTable 37.9\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nMeasure the height of the rectangle by subtracting the value of\nthe trend lines from each other. For upward breakouts, add the\nheight to the top trend line; for downward breakouts, subtract the\nvalue from the bottom trend line. The result is the expected mini-\nmum price move. For a maximum price target, measure the length\nof the rectangle and extend it vertically above the top trend line\n(for upward breakouts) or below the bottom one (downward\nbreakouts). The price then becomes the maximum expected move.\nWait for breakout\nSince you cannot be sure in which direction a rectangle will break\nout, wait for price to close outside the trend line before trading in\nthe direction of the breakout.\nTall rectangle scalp\nIf the rectangle is tall enough, sell or sell short near the top trend\nline and buy or cover near the bottom trend line.\nThrowbacks, \nIf you have a downward breakout, watch for a pullback and short \npullbacks\nthe stock or add to your short position once prices begin descend-\ning again. Use the same technique for an upward breakout: Wait\nfor the throwback then initiate or add to your position when\nprices rise.\nOther\nWatch for rectangles forming as the corrective phase of a\nmeasured move formation and adjust the target price accordingly.\nRectangle reversals sometimes appear as flat bottom formations.",

Place the trade after\nprice closes outside the rectangle trendline, and then trade with the trend.\nTall rectangle scalp. If the formation is tall enough, consider placing an\nintraformation trade near the two trend lines. Short at the top when prices\nbegin descending, and cover when they rebound off the bottom trend line (do\nnot cover too soon as prices may continue moving down). Go long at the bot-\ntom and sell at the top trend line when prices begin falling. Again, wait for a\ndirection change as prices may stage an upward breakout.\nThrowbacks, pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks allow investors\nanother opportunity to place a trade, add to their position, or get out with a\nsmaller loss. Take advantage of it but wait for prices to complete their throw-\nback or pullback before placing a trade or adding to a position. The reason for\nwaiting is that prices may continue in the adverse direction instead of return-\ning to the trend line and rebounding.\nOther. Sometimes, rectangle bottoms form as the corrective phase of a\nmeasured move formation. See the Measured Move Down chapter for informa-\ntion on how to take advantage of the situation. Occasionally a rectangle will mark\nthe end of a substantial decline and appear like a flat bottom before prices rise.\nSample Trade\nFigure 37.4 shows a paper trade I made. The rectangle bottom appeared after\nprices dropped from a high of 20.63 in October 1997. The drop was a painful\none but it did not occur all at once. Prices dropped quite rapidly to 15 where\nthey moved horizontally for 8 months. Then the second half of the decline\ntook over and prices reached a low of about 11.\nPrices bounced off the low several times, like a boy taking his first steps\non a trampoline. They were tentative, shaky, with not much enthusiasm. Then\nin mid-October 1998, prices touched the bottom trend line and moved quickly\nacross the formation to tie the September high at 12.38. A few more oscilla-\ntions and the two trend-line boundaries became apparent.\nIf you look at the overall picture, you might think that prices would con-\ntinue down—a downward breakout (following the downward trend). I could\nnot tell which direction prices would go, so I decided to wait for the breakout.\nIf the formation acted as a consolidation, then the breakout would be down-\nward. However, with a two-step downtrend from the high at 20.63, this\nreminded me of a measured move down with a long corrective phase. I thought\nit might break out upward. If the rectangle were taller, I would try an intrafor-\nmation trade (buy at 11.13, sell at 12.38, and then reverse).\nIn early December, prices pierced the top trend line and closed above it;\nstaging an upward breakout. I noticed the breakout the day after it happened\nand bought the stock 13, midrange for the day.\nSample Trade\n577",

I took a paper loss of 11%. After a second upward breakout, price contin-\nued rounding over, then dropped, and finally hit bottom at 8.88 in March 1999\nbefore recovering to 16 and change.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select RBs that perform\nbetter after the breakout. Consult the associated table for more information.\n• Review the identification guidelines for correct selection—Table 37.1.\n• Trade with the prevailing market trend: go long in a bull market and\nshort a bear market. Avoid countertrend trades—Table 37.2.\n• Rectangles in bear markets with downward breakouts have the lowest\nfailure rates for declines up to 10%. After that, rectangles in bull mar-\nkets with upward breakouts do better—Table 37.3.\n• Select rectangles with upward breakouts in the middle of the yearly\ntrading range; downward breakouts near the yearly low—Table 37.4.\n• Throwbacks and pullbacks hurt performance, so look for overhead\nresistance or underlying support before trading—Table 37.4.\n• About half the rectangles with downward breakouts reach the ultimate\nlow within 3 weeks. Watch your short trade carefully. Upward break-\nouts take longer to top out, so be patient—Table 37.5.\n• Select tall and wide patterns—Table 37.6.\n• Choose most rectangles with a rising volume trend and heavy breakout\nvolume—Table 37.7.\n• Use a partial rise or decline to predict the breakout direction—Table\n37.8.\n578\nRectangle Bottoms",

A pre-formation rise or decline is when price bumps up or down just\nbefore the rectangle starts.

At the start, prices\novershoot both up and down by peeking outside the two trend lines. This\nmovement is not a problem because it occurs too early in the chart pattern\nbefore it can be recognized as a rectangle.\nThe volume pattern begins in the typical manner—receding. However,\nabout two-thirds of the way to the breakout, the pattern changes. Volume gets\nheavier as if building pressure for the upcoming release. Then, mysteriously,\nvolume subsides as prices move horizontally just below the top trend line for\nover a week. When prices pierce the top trend line, volume picks up but not\nremarkably so. Volume just builds on the expanding trend that is developing\nsince prices began sliding along the trend line top.\nPrices climb away cleanly. There is a slight, 3-day dip in late June when\nit looks as if prices are trying to throw back to the formation top, but the buy-\ning pressure is just too strong. The retrace stops and prices turn around and\ncontinue moving up.\nWhy do rectangles form? A rectangle chart pattern is a struggle between\nthe haves and the have-nots. Those that own the stock but want to sell have\nidentified a price at which they are willing to part with their shares. When the\nprice reaches that level, they sell, forcing the price down. When prices fall,\nthey quit dumping the stock. On the other side is another group of investors\nwho want to acquire the stock. They place buy orders at what they perceive to\nbe the fair value.

Over time, you can draw a hori-\nzontal trend line along the peaks and another along the valleys as a rectangle\nformation takes shape. Eventually, one of the sides runs out of ammunition. If\nthe people selling their shares run out first, buying demand overwhelms sup-\nply and the price pierces the top trend line. If the buyers spend all their money\nand back away from the table, prices drop through the bottom of the rectangle.\nIn either case, the shares continue in the breakout direction because of grow-\ning demand (the price moves upward) or increasing supply (the price tumbles).\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 38.1 shows identification guidelines for rectangle tops.\nRising price trend. Over the short to intermediate term, the price trend\nshould be leading up to the formation. This upward trend is what distinguishes\nthe formation from rectangle bottoms. The distinction is arbitrary; I wanted to\nsee if there is any difference in the way the two perform.\nHorizontal trend lines. As a rectangle forms, prices rise to a resistance\nlevel and fall back to a support area for another try. If this pattern continues,\nthe minor highs can be joined with a trend line drawn along the top of the for-\nmation, and another trend line can be drawn below the minor lows. The two\ntrend lines are horizontal or nearly so. If there is a slight tilt to the trend line,\ndo not worry as long as it does not disturb the overall appearance of a conges-\ntion region.\nTouches. To qualify as a rectangle, prices must touch each trend line at\nleast twice. The touches need not alternate from one trend line to the other,\nbut the minor highs and lows must be distinct. You do not want to see two\ntouches along the top as part of the same minor high. Instead, look for two dis-\ntinct hills and two valleys at a minimum.\nVolume. The volume trend varies from formation to formation but usu-\nally recedes. Many of the charts accompanying this chapter show such a trend.\n582\nRectangle Tops\nTable 38.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nRising price trend\nThe short- to intermediate-term price trend leading to the\nformation should be up.\nHorizontal trend lines\nTwo horizontal (or nearly so) trend lines outline the price action,\none above the minor highs and one below the minor lows.\nTouches\nThere should be at least two touches of each trend line (at\nleast four touches total).\nVolume\nVolume usually recedes until the breakout.",

Bear market, downward breakout patterns show a similar trend.\nThose two scenarios show the lowest failure rates because they follow the\nmarket trend. Countertrend moves, bear market, up breakout and bull market,\ndown breakout, have worse failure rates.\nNotice how the failure rates start comparatively small and then climb\nrapidly.

The average rectangle length is quite stable\nacross breakout directions and market conditions, ranging from 71 to 82 days.\nHeight and width combinations. Pop quiz: If tall RTs perform best,\nand wide RTs perform best, will rectangles that are both tall and wide perform\nbest? No. It never ceases to surprise me when the obvious fails to occur. RTs\nthat are both tall and narrow perform best except those in a bear market with\nan upward breakout.\nTable 38.7 shows volume-related statistics for rectangle tops.\nVolume trend. In most cases, rectangle tops show better performance\nafter the breakout when volume was trending down within the rectangle. The\nexception is for rectangles with downward breakouts in a bull market. They do\nbetter with rising volume, but the results are close: 18% to 17%.\n588\nRectangle Tops\nTable 38.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High or Low\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market, \nup breakout\n22%\n11%\n7%\n5%\n5%\n3%\n4%\n2%\n6%\n5%\n31%\nBull market, \nup breakout\n11%\n7%\n5%\n4%\n5%\n5%\n2%\n4%\n2%\n1%\n56%\nBear market, \ndown \nbreakout\n31%\n15%\n8%\n9%\n5%\n4%\n1%\n9%\n1%\n3%\n15%\nBull market, \ndown \nbreakout\n23%\n9%\n6%\n9%\n6%\n7%\n6%\n1%\n4%\n1%\n29%",

On average, your profits should be larger with lower risk providing\nyou use stops to limit adverse moves. If price touches the horizontal rectangle\ntrend line and reverses instead of breaking out, close out the trade immedi-\nately. Chances are prices are going to cross the rectangle to the other side.\nWhen a partial decline occurs, performance suffers. That finding makes\nsense because the move is lower and it weakens upward momentum. However,\nwhen a partial rise occurs, performance improves, but not by much. I did not\nseparate partial rise and decline performance into bull and bear markets.\nPre-formation rises or drops. A pre-formation rise (PR) or drop (PD)\nis what I call a quick up or down move before the rectangle starts. Figure 38.1\nshows both; Figure 38.3 shows a PD.\nPre-formation rises have low sample counts and the results are all over\nthe map. Sometimes a PR helps performance (in bear markets) and sometimes\nnot (bull markets).\nWith pre-formation drops, the news is all good. When a PD occurs, per-\nformance either stays the same or, usually, improves, sometimes substantially.\nWhy this is the case is a mystery to me, but if it changes a 34% rise into a 45%\none, then it is worth paying attention to.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 38.9 explains trading tactics for rectangle tops.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule predicts the minimum target price.\nFirst, compute the height of the rectangle by subtracting the value of the lower\ntrend line from the upper one. Add the difference to the top trend line for\nupward breakouts and subtract it from the bottom trend line for downward\nbreakouts. The result is the target price.\nFor an example of the measure rule and how it applies to rectangles, con-\nsider the rectangle top pictured in Figure 38.4. The top trend line has a value of\n38.75, whereas the bottom one perches at 33.75. The difference of 5 is the height\nof the rectangle. If this rectangle were to break out downward, then the target\nprice would be 28.75, or the lower trend line value minus the formation height.\nSince the breakout is upward, add the height to the top trend line, giving a tar-\nget price of 43.75. Prices reach the target about a month after the breakout.\nI have read that to compute the maximum price move, one physically\nmeasures the length of the rectangle and applies it to the top trend line for\nupward breakouts or subtracts it from the bottom trend line for downward\nbreakouts. When using my computer, the technique comes close to the ulti-\nmate high. On paper, the results are less accurate. I have not tested this method\nextensively and cannot vouch for its accuracy. However, one has to wonder\nhow measuring a formation (in inches) can accurately translate into a price\nmove; but, who knows, the system might work or at least prove helpful.\nTrading Tactics\n591",

    "text": "Consolidation, breakout. Returning to Table 38.9, the breakout direc-\ntion is usually in the direction of the prior trend. For Figure 38.4 the direction\nis upward and that is the direction in which the breakout occurs. Once price\ncloses outside a formation, then a breakout (or premature breakout) occurs. If\nthe breakout is upward, go long or cover your short. If the breakout is down-\nward, then short the stock or sell your position.\nTall rectangle scalp. If the rectangle is tall enough and providing you\ndiscover it quickly enough, you can trade the formation as it swings from trend\nline to trend line. Short or sell at the top trend line and cover or buy at the bot-\ntom trend line. Keep an eye on the price trend leading to the formation in case\na breakout occurs. If the stock moves outside the rectangle trend line and you\nare losing money, close out your position. You might also want to get on the\nbandwagon and trade in the direction of the new trend.\nIf the breakout turns into a premature breakout when prices return to the\nrectangle proper, do not panic. There is still a chance that prices will resume\ntheir original breakout direction. Again, if the trade goes against you by shoot-\ning out the other side of the rectangle, then close out your position and do it\nquickly. If you hesitate, you may have another opportunity to add to your posi-\ntion or close it out if the formation pulls back or throws back. Take advantage\nof it especially if you are losing money. Often, prices will return to the forma-\ntion boundary and then turn away. If you do not get out during the pullback or\nthrowback, then it is likely your losses will grow. Do not pass up the second\nchance and do not hope that prices will continue recovering. They will not!\nOther. Before placing a trade in a rectangle formation, see if the chart pat-\ntern is part of a larger pattern. Sometimes, the rectangle is the horizontal part,\ncalled the corrective phase, of a measured move up formation. Knowing that a\nrectangle is a subpart of a measured move allows you to get a better gauge on the\nexpected price move. When the rectangle top is a reversal of the prevailing price\ntrend, the resulting formation resembles a flat top. Suspect that a reversal might\nbe under way if the price trend leading up to the rectangle is unusually steep.\nSample Trade\nDave is an artist. It is tough making a living and he wants to move to the com-\nputer world and become a graphics artist. He has been playing around with\nsome hardware and software that duplicate the feel of a brush on various tex-\ntures but wants to get the latest versions.\nRecognizing chart patterns comes easily to him. With his keen eye, he has\nbeen on the prowl for a lucrative stock play. That is one reason he stumbled\nacross the rectangle shown in Figure 38.4, but he did not spot the rectangle in a\ntimely fashion. The only reason he noticed it is because of the throwback. Throw-\nbacks and pullbacks are peculiar enough with their hooking retrace that they are\neasy to spot. One has only to look back and identify the associated formation.\nSample Trade\n593",

    "text": "Rounding bottoms, rounding turns, and saucers are synonyms for the same\nformation. Rounding bottoms (RdBs) have a low break-even failure rate with\na large average rise, so they perform well. Because the pattern can be tall—like\na bowl with high sides instead of a shallow saucer—the measure rule price tar-\nget (“Percentage meeting price target” in the Results Snapshot) may be hard to\nreach. Just over half of the RdBs hit their targets.\nSurprises for RdBs are plentiful, and the one that continues to amaze me\nis that these so-called bottom patterns are not bottoms at all. If they were bot-\ntoms, they would act as reversals. Occasionally, price does reverse course and\nthe RdB acts as a true bottom. More likely, however, is that RdBs appear in a\nrising price trend, a rounding turn in which traders catch their breath before\nthe climb resumes.\nTour\nFigure 39.1 shows an example of a rounding bottom on a daily scale. I would\nnot call it a good example because the bottom is too irregular. In mid-May\nthere is an out-of-pattern downward price decline that ends with price quickly\nrebounding. In late June price jumps up then fades back down. The June rise\nis not uncommon so do not get too excited when it happens in a stock you own.\nPrice should return to near the base of the rounding bottom before continuing\nthe rise.

    "text": "A rounding bottom marks a struggle between buying demand and selling\npressure that is nearly equal. Through the first part of the formation, the sell-\ners have the upper hand as they drive prices lower. Eventually, the forces come\ninto balance and the stock bottoms out and moves horizontally. Later still,\nbuying demand picks up and the stock inches upward. The climb is not always\na smooth one. Sometimes, a large upward demand spike occurs sending the\nprice skyrocketing, but in a month or so prices head back down and plane out\nslightly above where they left off. Then they resume their climb. When the\nstock reaches the old high, selling pressure usually drives prices lower, forming\na handle. Prices recover and break through the old high and push higher still.\nIdentification Guidelines\nAs chart patterns go, rounding bottoms are easy to identify. Table 39.1 lists\nguidelines for their identification.\nWeekly scale, rounded bowl shape. Since rounding bottoms are often\nquite long (in this study, the longest is over 21⁄2 years), I usually use the weekly\nscale to make identification easy. I search for a price pattern that looks like a\nbowl or saucer. Once I discover the pattern, a quick glance backward usually\nfinds prices trending upward. The rounding bottom is often a gentle retrace of\nsome of the gains.\nConsider Figure 39.2. The most recent up leg of the climb to the forma-\ntion begins in late December 1991 on very high volume. Prices climb 235% in\nabout 3 months, and then the stock eases over. The decline is not a quick\nstraight-down affair. Rather, the stock moves lower on its way to 4.25 by curv-\ning around and flattening out.\nOnce prices reach the low, they move hesitantly higher by traveling hor-\nizontally for several weeks before beginning an accelerated climb. Prices reach\nthe level of the left saucer lip and do not pause. They keep climbing until they\nreach 13 and then 16 before backing down to 11.\nIdentification Guidelines\n597\nTable 39.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nWeekly scale\nUse the weekly scale to identify these behemoths, although\nthe daily scale also works well.\nRounded bowl shape\nThe price trend curves gently, usually over many months\nand usually after an upward price trend. Connect the\nweekly low prices to visually construct a saucer or bowl\nshape in your mind.\nCurving volume trend\nThe volume trend sometimes mimics the price trend by\nappearing as a bowl but more often is dome shaped.",

    "text": "A rounding bottom does not require a handle, which is a price consolida-\ntion area that commonly forms immediately after the right saucer lip, but most\ntimes you will see one. A handle is typical behavior when prices reach an old\nhigh. The rise falters as tepid demand or excessive selling push prices lower;\nthen, the two highs act as a resistance zone. Sometimes, prices make several\nattempts before pushing through the resistance and moving higher; sometimes,\nprices just give up and roll back downhill.\nCurving volume trend. The volume trend occasionally echoes the price\ntrend by rounding downward too. You can see this in Figure 39.2 although it\nis not as pronounced as it some times is. However, a dome shape predominates\n54% of the time; a saucer or U shape, 46% of the time.\nFocus on Failures\nAlthough RdBs have a low failure rate, they occasionally fail, and Figure 39.3\nshows an example of a failure. This rounding bottom (points A and B) occurs\nin a downward price trend, but the bottom is not as smooth as I like to see. The\nstart of the pattern, A, is not well defined as the pause lasts just a few days.

The stock tried to pierce\nit but failed and dropped, eventually reaching a low of 8.56.\nThese types of situations are easy to diagnose. Before trading, always look\nfor overhead resistance and underlying support. Knowing when price is likely\nto stop will give you valuable information. It may be that the trade will not be\nprofitable enough if it hits a wall of resistance. The loss as prices tumble to the\nsupport zone may be too large to risk a trade. If the trade does not look right\nor if the risk versus reward is not low enough, then look for a more promising\ntrade. Good trades (and patterns) are worth waiting for.\nStatistics\nTable 39.2 shows general statistics for rounding bottoms.\nNumber of formations. I found 453 RdBs in 500 stocks from mid-1991\nto mid-1996 and from 2000 to 2003. Those periods covered the bull and bear\nmarket. However, not all of the stocks in the bear market covered the 3-year\nrange (think mergers and buyouts).\nReversal or continuation. Unlike other patterns that are true bottoms, a\nrounding bottom acts as a consolidation or continuation of the prevailing price\ntrend slightly more often than as a reversal.

In essence, this activ-\nity represents the handle length (after the right lip). The implication here is that\nyou have plenty of time to trade this pattern, even if you do not recognize it dur-\ning development. Trade RdBs only after price closes above the right lip.\nYearly position. Most RdBs have their breakout within a third of the\nyearly high. Since the chart pattern is a long one and the breakout is near the\ntop of the pattern, the numbers are not surprising.\nYearly position, performance. Mapping performance onto the yearly\nprice range, we find that the best performing RdBs are those with breakouts\nnear the yearly high. The results may change with additional samples, espe-\ncially in a bull market.\nThrowbacks. Throwbacks occur less often in RdBs than in many other\nchart patterns, but I do not know why. Prices take the usual amount of time to\nreturn to the breakout price (9 to 12 days). When throwbacks do occur, the\npostbreakout rise averages 33% in a bull market and 28% in a bear market.\nWhen a throwback is absent, performance improves: 50% and 33%, respec-\ntively. Thus, throwbacks retard upward momentum and performance suffers.\nBefore trading, look for overhead resistance and trade patterns without it.\nGaps. Breakout day gaps hurt performance but only in a bear market—\n32% rise without a gap versus 26% with.\nTable 39.5 shows the time it takes prices to reach the ultimate high. Few\npatterns flame out in the first week. Most take over 2.5 months (70 days) to top\nout. Such a long time gives price the opportunity to make an extended move\n(on average, it takes longer to rise farther).\nNotice that a month into the trade, 9% of the patterns in a bear market\nreach the ultimate high (a slight blip). That event may be a warning sign of\nweakness. I have seen this behavior in other patterns, so if price stalls a month\ninto the trade, consider selling. Bull markets peak a week earlier.\nTable 39.6 shows size statistics for the rounding bottom pattern.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform better than short ones, especially in a bull\nmarket (52% versus 38%). I used the median pattern height—from highest\nhigh to lowest low—divided by the breakout price as the benchmark. Tall pat-\nterns had results above the median, so trade those.

Add the height to the value of the right\nsaucer lip to get the target price. In this case, the target is 37.88 and prices\nreach that level in late January.\nWait for breakout, watch for handle.

He decided to get there one trade at a time, taking a\nlonger time to trade and working down to interday trading.\nIn December, as he was flipping through his charts, he came across what\nappeared to be a mild double bottom. On the daily chart the two bottoms in\nAugust and November were barely discernible. Was it a valid formation and\nshould he buy the stock now? Glen decided that the retrace between the two\nbottoms was not high enough and the two bottoms not clear enough to be\nworth considering. He justified his action by thinking that if he was having a\nhard time spotting the formation, then others would have the same trouble. If\nno one spots the formation, then prices will not rise.\nWhen he flipped to the weekly chart, it changed the characterization of\nwhat he was seeing. On his screen was an obvious rounding bottom. The vol-\nume pattern supported the conclusion: receding as prices declined and round-\ning up as prices rose. So, he decided to wait for the rounding bottom to stop\nnear the prior saucer lip at about 21.38. When it paused for 2 weeks in Febru-\nary, he knew the formation was primed. The question then became, what was\nit going to do next? The only way to find that out was to wait.\n606\nRounding Bottoms\nAlco Standard Corp.

In this example, the turn is a gentle one but still has irregular price\nmoves poking through (points C and D). Volume trends upward in this exam-\nple, but that is unusual for rounding turns.\nThe reason a rounding turn occurs is not difficult to explain. Prices move\nup on bullish enthusiasm confirmed by high volume at the start. Knowing that\nprices are climbing, sellers hold onto their shares a bit longer, forcing demand\nto climb along with the share price. However, as prices rise, buying demand\ntapers off and eventually catches up to supply. Prices round over at the top.\nSince the shares are fetching a premium to intrinsic value, more sellers appear.\nThe smart money starts selling, too, and the price drops.\nOnce investors discover the upward price momentum has turned, selling\npressure increases, forcing the price down. Volume may pick up as more\ntraders try to dump their shares as prices decline. Eventually, the decline ends\nwhen nervous novices toss in the towel and sell their holdings. When all those\nwho considered selling their shares have sold, the smart money jumps in and\nbuys the stock, or sell it short, eventually pushing the stock to new highs\n(upward breakout) or new lows (downward breakout).\n610\nRounding Tops\nA\nC\nD\nB\nConfirmation Line\nBreakout\nAlpharma (Medical Supplies, NYSE, ALO)\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n95\nMay\nApr\nMar\nJun\nJul\nFeb\nAug\nNov\nDec\nJan 96\nFigure 40.1\nA rounding turn begins at point A and rounds over to end near\nwhere it begins (B).

Buying demand often cuts\nthe decline short before prices return to where they started.\nEven end prices. Look for the ends of the RdT to be near the same price,\nsay, within 5% (but allow variations). In the 776 patterns I looked at, the bottom-\nto-bottom price variation averaged 3%, with the end usually slightly higher than\nthe start 52% of the time.

Volume is dome shaped, but that is\ntypical for rounding turns—it happens 43% of the time.\nBuying demand and selling pressure determines stock price movement.\nFundamentals drive those forces. If news comes out that a company is consid-\nering bankruptcy, you can be sure the stock price is going down. Most news\ninfluences price less.\nFor example, beginning in late January 2002, natural gas prices started ris-\ning and broke out upward from a symmetrical triangle in March, just as the stock\nmade a new minor high. Gas prices peaked in May and started a long slide that\nended in August. By contrast, the stock peaked in March 2002 and continued\nlower. Thus, even as natural gas was making new highs, the stock was tumbling—\n“diverging” as we call it. However, both the stock and natural gas bottomed\nwithin a few weeks of each other, with the stock leading the way higher.\nTechnical factors also influence price movement and contribute to a pat-\ntern failure. For example, if you know that Joe Trader is buying and his record\nis the envy of the industry, you may want to buy, too. This herd instinct is what\nmomentum is all about. Another example: Mutual funds spread their trades\nover several brokers and try to keep their elephant-like movements secret.\nTheir large trades can cause price swings, so they spread their orders over time\nto lessen the impact. If you see a broker that handles trades for a mutual fund\nselling a large block of shares, you may want to dump your holdings too (or\nshort the stock). This selling pressure contributes to downward momentum.\nFocus on Failures\n613\nOverhead\nResistance\nA\nB\nNational Fuel Gas (Natural Gas (Diversified), NYSE, NFG)\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n01\nMay\nMar\nMar\nApr\nApr\nJun\nJul\nFeb\nAug\nSep Oct\nNov\nDec\nJan 02\nFigure 40.3\nOverhead resistance blocks this rounding turn’s upward breakout.",

However, the rise in a bear market is\nnot too shabby either: 53%. The key is finding the ultimate low. Even if you\nwait for a 20% rise, which signals a trend change, you still have over 30 per-\ncentage points left in which to participate (on average). Use a stop-loss order\nto protect your position.\nBusted pattern performance. The pattern really performs when it\nbusts. By that, I mean price moves less than 5% beyond the breakout before\nreversing and heading off in the new direction. The downside is that few pat-\nterns bust (fewer than 30 in each column), so trading opportunities are limited.\nEven worse, it will be difficult to tell a busted pattern from a common retrace\nunless you wait for prices to move to the opposite end of the pattern. That\nwaiting sacrifices a majority of the move.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change. Notice how the strength of the average\nrise or decline follows the market trend.

The rise in a bull market (37% in 161\ndays) takes longer to reach the ultimate high than the decline in a bear market\n(23% in 25 days) takes to reach the ultimate low. The decline must be steeper\nthan the rise. This finding implies that you can make more trades in a bear\nmarket than in a bull one, but the profit will average considerably less.\nTable 40.3 shows failure rates for RdTs. The lowest failure rates associ-\nate with the market trend: trading long in a bull market and short in a bear\nmarket. Countertrend trades have more risk. For example, 20% of the RdTs in\nbull markets with upward breakouts fail to rise more than 10%, but in a bear\nmarket, 36% fail to rise as far. Half the patterns (51%) in a bear market fail to\ndrop more than 20%, but 57% in a bull market fail to drop 20%.\nYou can see how the failure rates start low and quickly climb for small\nchanges in the maximum price rise or decline. For example, RdTs in a bear\nmarket with downward breakouts show failures of 9%, 22%, and 39% for\ndeclines of 5%, 10%, and 15%, respectively.

Once prices drop to the right rim, they\ntake between 2 and 4 months, on average, to climb above the pattern’s high.\nFor downward breakouts, the delay is shorter but still quite long, about 2\nmonths (58 to 79 days).\nI expected the shortest time to the breakout to follow the market trend.\nIf a rising tide lifts all boats, then that would help the stock climb faster. That\nexplanation sounds good but the numbers suggest otherwise for both bull and\nbear markets. Another explanation is that stocks in a bear market struggling to\nrise against the outgoing (falling) tide must have a very good reason to climb.\nThe enthusiasm powers the stocks upward much faster than stocks coasting\nupward in a rising market.\nThe key to successful trading is finding stocks in a bull market that have\na need to shoot higher or finding those in a bear market that not only want to\ncrash and burn, but also dig a hole so deep as to reach the earth’s core.\nYearly position. As you might guess, upward breakouts appear near the\nyearly high and downward breakouts occur often near the yearly low.\nYearly position, performance. With most of the patterns hovering near\nthe yearly high or digging near the yearly low, the sample counts are few for\nthe other extremes. Keeping that finding in mind, RdTs perform best when the\nbreakout is near the yearly low.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. A throwback or pullback occurs about half\nthe time. It takes, on average, 9 days for price to return to the breakout price.\nWhen a throwback or pullback occurs, performance usually suffers. The lone\nexception is for RdTs with upward breakouts in a bear market. Those with\nthrowbacks rise 20%. Without throwbacks, the rise averages 19%.\nGaps. I am not sure how important the gap performance numbers are\nbecause with a breakout up to 4 months after the end of the pattern, who is\ngoing to notice a breakout day gap? However, in all cases, gaps helped per-\nformance, sometimes substantially. Notice how large gaps are during a down-\nward breakout.\nTable 40.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Notice how many RdTs have a trend change in the first week or two. The\nworst case is for downward breakouts in a bear market. Almost 60% hit bottom\nin the first 2 weeks. That finding seems odd because the breakout direction is\nin the direction of the market trend. Thus, the down move must be violent and\nsuggests that you should short the stock before the breakout. Otherwise you\nmay miss a potentially large move (think breakaway gap on the breakout day).\nLook for the general market (S&P 500 index) and industry to be trending\ndownward, an absence of underlying support, and a price downtrend before\nthe RdT. If those conditions exist, consider shorting the stock. The stock will\nbottom at the right rim and then bounce up for a month or two. When it peaks\nduring the bounce and starts moving down again, short the stock. That move\nshould get you on the correct side of the trade before the breakout.

You have plenty of time to\nbuy in, but you have to be patient to get a good return.\nTable 40.6 shows statistics related to pattern size.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform better than short ones in all market con-\nditions and breakout directions. For example, RdTs taller than the median in\na bull market have gains averaging 41%, but short ones rise only 34%.\nWidth. RdTs narrower than the median perform well when the breakout\nis upward. I used the median length as the separator between narrow and wide.\nAverage formation length. The average pattern length varies from 83 to\n138 days. Notice how the average is larger than the median, suggesting that\nlarge outliers pull the average upward.\nHeight and width combinations. Which combination of height and\nwidth works best? RdTs that are both tall and narrow perform best. The worst\nperformance comes from short and narrow or short and wide patterns.\nTable 40.7 shows volume-related statistics for rounding tops.\nVolume trend. Patterns with a falling volume trend outperform those\nwith a rising volume trend in all cases but one (bull market, down breakout).\nFor example, in a bull market, up breakout, RdTs with a rising volume trend\nhad postbreakout gains averaging 33%, but those with a falling volume trend\ngained 41%.\nVolume shapes. Most of the time, RdTs with U-shaped volume perform\nbetter than the other shapes. The one exception is for RdTs in a bear market\nwith an upward breakout. When volume has a dome shape, RdTs perform\nbetter (21% versus 19%).\n618\nRounding Tops\nTable 40.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High or Low\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market, \nup breakout\n25%\n6%\n6%\n6%\n8%\n4%\n2%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n37%\nBull market, \nup breakout\n15%\n3%\n5%\n5%\n4%\n4%\n3%\n4%\n2%\n2%\n55%\nBear market, \ndown \nbreakout\n46%\n13%\n9%\n8%\n6%\n2%\n3%\n1%\n0%\n2%\n9%\nBull market, \ndown \nbreakout\n25%\n8%\n10%\n10%\n6%\n4%\n7%\n6%\n2%\n2%\n21%",

When using the rule, be sure to look for resistance\nareas. They are the areas where the price rise is likely to stall, forcing the mea-\nsure rule to underperform. To use the measure rule, subtract the lowest low at\nthe right rim from the highest high in the formation, which gives the forma-\ntion height. In Figure 40.4, point A shows the lowest low at the end, 45.63,\nwhereas point B depicts the highest high at 49.88.

If you like to take more risk, buy at a lower price\n(one-third of the formation height, above the right dome low). I use the 30%\nretrace amount since a rise of that magnitude usually breaks a down-sloping\ntrend line that sometimes forms as prices decline during the rounding turn.

Then she held\non and watched the stock daily. As prices rose, she noticed that the oscillations\nfrom minor high to minor low seemed to be narrowing. To her, these oscilla-\ntions indicated that a rising wedge was forming, but the volume pattern was\nabnormal. With a rising wedge, the volume pattern tends to recede over time.\nIn early September, Sharon grew alarmed because the volume trend\nbegan to decline drastically. Her studies showed a tendency for a severe\ndropoff in volume just before a rising wedge breakout, so the day after prices\npierced the lower wedge trend line, she sold the stock at 62.\nHer analysis was perfect.

I\nhighlight this formation with some consternation. When hunting for scallops,\none should look at the price lows, not the highs. If you connect the minor lows\nof the first two formations, you see that prices have a bowl shape. The bowl\nshape is not clear in the smallest formation unless you trace along the highs.\nThe smallest formation in Figure 41.1 also has the best volume pattern—\na U-shaped trend.

The two peaks\nshould not be near each other in price (otherwise, you have a cup with handle,\nrounding turn, or even a double top chart pattern).\nVolume. Volume usually resembles the price pattern: higher at the ends\nthan in the middle. However, do not exclude a scallop with domed or other\nshaped volume.\nWidth. Wide scallops usually mark the start of a rising price trend and\nnarrow ones appear near the end of the trend. I base this observation on the\naverage scallop width, so sometimes you see just the opposite: a wide scallop at\nthe end of a trend and narrower ones near the start.\nUneven ends. In a series of scallops, many times the highest scallop in\nthe series will look like a rounding turn or double top with the start and end of\nthe scallop sharing almost the same price. A downward breakout may follow\nimmediately or a trend change will occur soon after. A check of the database\nshows that scallops with starting and ending prices near each other perform\nless well than do those priced farther apart.\nFigure 41.2 shows two examples of ascending scallops, the first with an\nupward breakout and the second with a downward one. An upward breakout\noccurs when price closes above the highest high in the pattern (point A); a\ndownward breakout happens when price closes below the lowest low (point B).\nBoth patterns have dome-shaped volume, which is unusual for scallops.\nThe J shape of each scallop is well defined with the end far above the\nprice at the start. Between the beginning and end is a rounded-looking reces-\nsion forming the bottom of the pattern.

A 5% failure is when price breaks\nout in the intended direction but fails to continue moving in the same direction\nby more than 5%.

Prices round up nicely and continue higher while the vol-\nume pattern is bowl-shaped if you disregard the twin spikes in early May.\nHowever, the late June formation marks the high for the stock. Again, there is\nreally nothing wrong with the pattern. The J shape is pronounced and smooth.\nThe volume pattern is somewhat rugged but higher on either end than in the\ncenter.

The rates are higher\nthan those for many other chart patterns. Consider that 27% of the scallops in\na bull market with downward breakouts decline less than 5% after the break-\nout. Nearly half (46%) drop less than 10%. Clearly, you want to avoid trading\nagainst the market trend.\nNotice how the failure rates climb. They double for moves from 5% to\n10% in most cases. They climb by half for moves from 10% to 15%. Let me\ngive you an example. Scallops in a bull market with upward breakouts have\n10% failing to rise more than 5%. The failures double to 21% for rises of just\n10% and the failure rate climbs to 30% for moves under 15%. That failure rate\n(30%) is triple the break-even rate of 10%.\nThe best performance comes from scallops that trade with the market\ntrend: upward breakouts in a bull market and downward breakouts in a bear\nmarket. They have the lowest failure rates. Scallops in a bear market with\nupward breakouts do better for larger moves than those with downward break-\nouts. That is, after a 15% move, the failure rates for upward breakouts are\nlower than are those for downward breakouts.\nTable 41.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\nFormation end to breakout.

At the other end of the scale, half of the bull market pat-\nterns are still searching for the ultimate high after more than 2 months.\nThe table gives you some idea of how long your trade may take, given the\nvarying market conditions and breakout directions.

    "text": "The ascending and inverted scallop is a pattern I discovered a few years ago. I\nthen wondered whether ascending and descending scallops had inverted coun-\nterparts and what they might look like. It did not take long before I discovered\nthe inverted and ascending variety. I thought it showed great promise and\nstudied it briefly before setting it aside. This chapter takes a closer look at the\npattern’s performance and explores its many surprises.\nThe formation looks like a backward and upside-down J or the right half\nof an open umbrella. The breakeven failure rate is low, 4% in bull markets, and\n7% in bear markets, but climbs quickly. The average postbreakout rise is 43%\nin bull markets and 26% in bear markets, both numbers are very good.\nAs noted in the Results Snapshot, a number of surprises occur with this\npattern. I will discuss them in detail later in the chapter.\nTour\nWhat does an ascending and inverted scallop look like? Figure 42.1 shows two\nexamples. Notice that the long-term price trend is upward, starting in the fall\nof 1996 and climbing in a stair-step pattern until February, and then declining\nleading to the scallop.\n640\nScallops, Ascending and Inverted\nA\nB\nC\nMerck and Co., Inc.

The volume trend is unremark-\nable, except for a slight downward tilt. The second scallop starts at B and ends\nat C. The volume trend of this scallop is dome shaped as shown.\nBoth scallops start with an uphill price run that is usually straight but\nrounds over at the top. I like to see a rounded top, but a nubbin or two stick-\ning out is fine. Sometimes the rounded shape appears not as a line connecting\nthe high prices, but the low prices. The key is that is looks like the right half of\nan umbrella or an upside down and backward J, tilted to one side.\nIdentification Guidelines\nAfter manually searching though hundreds of inverted scallops, I developed\nidentification guidelines, which appear in Table 42.1.\nDaily chart. I used the daily chart to find the pattern, but I am sure they\ncome out like worms after a heavy rain on most any time scale. The longer\nones appear on the weekly chart, but I did not check the intraday chart to see\nwhat they looked like or how they perform.\nUpward price trend. I selected scallops from a rising price trend. You do\nnot see them appear in a downtrend (because they do not confirm) except at\nbullish turning points. The turning point may be the start of a new upward\ntrend, but, more likely, it is the corrective phase of a measured move down. In\nother words, prices decline and then stop where the inverted scallop forms.\nIdentification Guidelines\n641\nTable 42.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nDaily chart\nUse the daily chart to find the pattern, although the larger\nones also appear on the weekly charts.\nUpward price trend\nSelect patterns that appear in an upward price trend or at\nthe bullish turning point of a downward price trend.\nInverted and backward \nPrices trend up then round over at the top, forming an \nJ shape\ninverted and backward J. It also looks like the right half of\nan umbrella.\nSmooth top\nLook for daily high prices that, when connected, form a\nsmooth turn. Larger patterns may not be as smooth\nbecause you are connecting minor highs.\nRetrace\nThe rounded top portion of the pattern usually retraces\nabout 50% of the prior up move. Prices must not drop\nbelow the pattern start.\nConfirmation price\nPrice must close above the highest high in the pattern.\nOnly then is the pattern valid.",

I ignored those patterns with a sharp or pointed top, but did\nallow a few that had a one-day tail shooting out the top. They reminded me of\na single tree on a hilltop.

Two short trees peak out\nthe hilltop and the pattern would appear better if a logger came along and har-\nvested them.

Second,\nalways search for support and resistance zones before investing. Those chart\npatterns are the most important as they help you gauge the expected price move\nin either direction. My book, Trading Classic Chart Patterns (Wiley 2002) gives\na good tutorial on support and resistance and includes performance statistics.\nFigure 42.5 shows the second type of failure.

You might\nguess the first one, and I admit the top looks more like a flat rectangle than a\nrounded scallop. The variation in patterns is so wide that you have to be flexi-\nble; you can always ignore the questionable ones and trade the sure things.\nThe middle pattern has a top that looks like a symmetrical triangle. The\nlast and highest scallop has no rounded turn to speak of. If you ignore the up-\nsloping top, the highest pattern is the dud because it does not confirm.

Since I found 535 chart patterns in over 200\nstocks from both bull and bear markets, I felt no need to search for more.

Splitting the samples into bull and bear markets\ngives the numbers shown in the table.\nReversal or continuation. Most scallops behaved as continuations of\nthe prevailing price trend. About a quarter (27% in a bull market and 25% in\na bear market) acted as reversals. Scallops acting as reversals performed better\nthan did those acting as continuations, especially in a bull market.\nAverage rise. The ascending and inverted scallop is a bullish pattern.\nPerhaps the average rise supports the “rising tide lifts all boats” theory. In a\nbull market, the average rise was 43%. In a bear market, the rise was 26%.\nBoth are above the averages for bullish chart patterns of other types.\nRises over 45%. Measuring the rises over 45% is a statement of how well\nthe pattern can perform. In bull markets, over a third (39%) of the inverted\nscallops climbed more than 45% after the breakout.

However,\nwith just 32 patterns out of 535 qualifying, the chance of finding one buried\ndown there is rare.\nThrowbacks. Throwbacks occur in nearly two-thirds of the trades.\nWhen they do occur, it takes a stock between 9 and 10 days, on average, to\nreturn to the breakout price. When a scallop throws back, performance suffers.\nFor example, when a throwback occurs after the breakout from a scallop in a\nbull market, the average postbreakout rise is 39%. Without a throwback, the\nrise averages 49%.\nGaps. Breakout day gaps improve performance in a bull market, but hurt\nit in a bear market. The average gap size is small, ranging from 36 to 47 cents.\nFor some reason, gaps in a bear market are usually larger.\nTable 42.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high.\nNotice the number of scallops topping out over 2.5 months after the breakout\n(70 days).\nThe numbers suggest that if your trade survives the first week, then be\npatient.

Yes, it gets shorter. I measured the height from the highest high to the\nlowest low in the pattern and divided the result by the breakout price (the\nhighest high in the pattern).

In a bull market, scallops with a rising volume trend out-\nperform, but in a bear market, the performance is better for those scallops with\na falling volume trend.\nVolume shapes.

In a bear market, the breakout volume has little effect.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 42.8 shows trading tactics for ascending and inverted scallops.\nSearch for nearby support and resistance.

Are you sure you have a valid ascending and inverted scal-\nlop? Review Table 42.1 for identification tips. Select scallops in an established,\nrising price trend and do not try to catch a reversal (those at the end of a down-\ntrend).

    "text": "higher, so this pattern comes up short. A better gauge is to use overhead resis-\ntance and assume that prices will turn back at that point. They may not, but\nthat is the way to estimate your reward (overhead resistance) and risk (under-\nlying support).\nWait for confirmation. Always wait for the pattern to become valid.\nThat happens when price closes above the pattern high, and that is also the buy\nsignal. Investing in a pattern before confirmation is best left to amateurs.\nSample Trade\nRobert looked at the chart shown as Figure 42.6 and liked the stock’s rising\nprice trend starting in April. He watched the first scallop form in September\nand October. The retrace of this pattern, ending at point A, was 83%—more\nthan he liked, so he ignored the potential trade. Such a large retrace may mean\nan especially weak technical picture, and scallops with large retraces tend to\nunderperform.\nWhen the second scallop formed during late October through early\nDecember, he saw that the retrace was a more palatable 64%.\nHe ran though the identification guidelines in Table 42.1 and found the\nfollowing: On the daily chart, the pattern was in a price uptrend, it looked like\nan inverted and backward J, the top was reasonably smooth, and prices did not\ndrop below point A, the scallop’s start. Meeting those guidelines qualified the\npattern as an ascending and inverted scallop.\nThe day after price closed above the scallop’s high, he bought. That tim-\ning turned out to be wrong as prices immediately tumbled. Robert is an expe-\nrienced trader and knows all about throwbacks, so he was not worried. Prices\nthrew back to point C, above his stop (which was placed a nickel below point\nB), before rebounding.\nRobert likes using trend lines as sell signals. He drew a trend line from\npoint A to point B and extended it upward (not shown). He knew that steep\ntrends tended to be short lived, but the upward climb was not steep enough to\nworry him. He redrew the trend line (shown) as prices climbed.\nFor fun, he computed the price target and it turned out to be 5.95. Prices\nclimbed through the target, pausing around 5, a round number and a common\nsupport and resistance zone, but eventually pushed their way through.\nSince prices kept bumping against the trend line without piercing it, he\nwas not worried . . . until early June. That is when prices tumbled through the\ntrend line with meaning. Coupled with excessively high volume a few days\nearlier, it seemed time to sell. That is what he did the following day (point D).\nRobert bought at 4.90 and sold at 6.50, for a gain of 33% in about 5\nmonths. From that point, it took over a year for prices to make a new high.\n652\nScallops, Ascending and Inverted",

    "text": "Identification Guidelines\nTable 43.1 shows identification characteristics of descending scallops.\nPrice trend. The descending scallops I looked at appeared in a down-\nward price trend 64% of the time, or about two of every three scallops. Since\ndescending scallops work best as bearish patterns, avoid trading those in an\nupward price trend. Sometimes you will see a descending scallop form at the\ntop of a long, upward price trend. It acts as a reversal when price breaks out\ndownward. It may be worth trading; the Sample Trade explores one such trade.\nShape. Look for a reverse J shape, with the left side of the scallop higher\nthan the right. The bowl at the bottom of the pattern should appear smooth\nand rounded, not excessively rough or V shaped. Allow variations: Tall but\nnarrow scallops may look more V shaped than wider scallops and often a price\nspike will poke out downward.\nEnds. The start and end of the pattern (point A and B in Figure 43.1)\nshould be far apart in price. The usual retrace, C to B, of the A to C distance\nis 60%. In other words, price climbs 60% of the way to A from the bowl low.\nSince this figure is an average, allow variations, but the key is to avoid scallops\nthat look like rounding turns—two ends at nearly the same price.\nVolume. Most of the time, 70%, volume will be dome shaped. I never\nexclude a scallop because of the volume shape, but scallops with upward break-\nouts perform better with dome-shaped volume, and scallops with downward\nbreakouts do best with U-shaped volume.\nFigure 43.2 shows four descending scallops. You can see that the overall\nprice trend is downward. It starts on the left at about 20 and saucers down to\nabout 15. The descending scallops appear like reverse J patterns. The minor\nhigh on the right is below the left minor high and between the two peaks is a\nrounded recession. You can see that the last scallop has minor highs that are\nnearly equal. This feature often suggests the declining price trend is nearing an\nend. In this case, prices reach the ultimate low in less than 2 months at 13.63,\nquite close to the last bowl low of 14.75.\nIdentification Guidelines\n657\nTable 43.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nPrice trend\nLook for a downward price trend leading to the scallop.

    "text": "The volume trend is irregular. I have noticed a tendency for a volume spike\nto appear near the center of the formation as prices switch from moving downward\nto upward. In Figure 43.2 you can see the spikes in late March and mid-June.\nFocus on Failures\nDescending scallops fail most often because of two other chart patterns: sup-\nport and resistance. Figure 43.3 shows the first example. The July scallop\nbegins at A and ends at B. The bowl has a downward price spike, making the\nturn less smooth than I like to see. Volume is dome shaped, which is typical for\ndescending scallops. After B, prices move down and it looks like they will drop\nbelow the bowl low and complete a breakout. Since price is declining leading\nto the scallop, down is the expected breakout direction. However, price comes\nclose to breaking out downward, but the close remains above the bowl low.\nWhen it closes above B at C, the pattern surprises with an upward breakout.\nPrices rise to the height of A and throw back to the price at B. Overhead resis-\ntance is the culprit. Numerous valleys touch the resistance line and a solid block of\nhorizontal price movement adds strength to the zone in January to March.\nAs in most throwbacks, prices recover and attempt a new high that suc-\nceeds, but not by much. Overhead resistance is there to swat it down and prices\ndrop below the pattern low. The rise from B to the resistance zone where\nprice stalls measures 5%.\nFigure 43.4 shows the second example of a failure, this time with a down-\nward breakout.

    "text": "Why did this descending scallop fail? The only explanation I can offer is\nhard to justify. There is meager support announced by the February low and\nthe gap in December 1998. Below that, a small pennant also provides support.\nIf I were trading this stock and saw the downward breakout, I would\nbelieve that prices would continue dropping. Perhaps the fundamentals explain\nthe robust support that stopped the decline, but my records do not go back that\nfar.

Compute the formation height by sub-\ntracting the low near B (21.11) from the high at A (23.75), giving a height of\n2.64.

    "text": "not trade a scallop until the breakout occurs unless you have a compelling rea-\nson for doing so. Remember that the breakout direction usually follows the\nprice trend leading to the pattern. For example, if price is trending down, expect\na downward breakout. In a strong bear market, an upward breakout may falter.\nStops. Since scallops perform so poorly, use a stop to protect any profits\nyou may have and to limit losses. A good starting point for downward break-\nouts is to use point C (see Figure 43.5) as the stop point. For upward breakouts,\nuse the formation low (B) as the stop-loss point.\nPlace the stop a few cents below the low (for long trades), preferably on\nan oddball number (20.93 instead of 21, for example). Every novice investor is\ngoing to use a round number, so position your stop below them. They will be\nstopped out, and you stand a better chance of having your trade left intact.\nSometimes though, this strategy will cause a larger loss because of stop run-\nning. That is when a stop causes price to decline, which trips additional stops,\nforcing prices even lower. To avoid this pitfall, place your stop above the oth-\ners, as in 21.07 instead of 21. That position also narrows your loss (for long\ntrades). Move the stop to just above the prior minor high (downward break-\nouts) or below the prior minor low (upward breakouts) as price advances. Since\nstop running seldom occurs, I place my stop below the round number.\nTrends. Since descending scallops work best in a declining price trend,\nshort the stock only in a bear market.

    "text": "Sample Trade\nFigure 43.5 shows the sample trade for descending scallops. How would you\ntrade the June scallop? The first thing you may notice is that it appears at the\nend of a long upward price trend. Thus, this scallop acts as a reversal. This fact\ndoes not become clear until price closes below point B, the lowest low in the\npattern. When that happens, it signals a downward breakout and a trend\nchange. That movement means shorting the stock (or selling shares you own),\na risky maneuver that should be left to serious traders and investors.\nBefore taking a position in the stock, use the measure rule to determine\nhow far prices will decline. I already discussed this in Trading Tactics, so refer\nto the measure rule discussion there for more information.\nLook for support and resistance zones. Overhead resistance will probably\noccur at the old high (in early June at 23.75), perhaps forming a double top.\nSupport appears at 19, as shown in Figure 43.5, set up by the base of a\nright-angled and ascending broadening formation. If price pierces 19, then I\nwould consider it likely to stall at 16. Although not shown in the figure, 16 is\nthe price at which the decline stalled during the summer and fall of 2001.\nAdditional support appears as a broadening top, centered near 14 and extend-\ning as far back as 1999.\nSince the measure rule target (18.47) and support (at 19) are nearly the\nsame price, that is where I would expect price to stop. If the market were also\ntrending down during the trade, an additional decline to the next support zone\n(16) might be possible or even likely. Below that might be a dream unless com-\npany fundamentals are in serious trouble.\nWith a breakout price of 21.11 and a target of 19, is a 5% decline worth\ntrading, especially a risky short sale? I do not think so. Suppose price declines\nto 16, for a 24% loss. Now we are talking!\nIf fundamental analysis shows the market flooded with nickel, copper,\ncobalt, or precious metals, all of which Inco produces, then the oversupply\nshould translate into lower stock prices. News such as that would give me con-\nfidence to short the stock.\nAccording to Table 43.4, a gap in a bear market suggests a larger decline\nthan without a gap. Suppose you shorted the stock at the close the day after the\ngap. That would be at 20.45, well below the formation low of 21.11.\nIn the coming days, price drops. For short-term traders, consider cover-\ning the short once price nears support at 19 or the predicted target of 18.47.\nMany times, the decline will fall short of the target and it may be prudent to\ntake your profits or tighten (lower) your stop. A lower stop allows you to cap-\nture more of your profit but still give the stock room to drop farther.\nIf you put an order to cover the short at 18.47, you would have missed it\nbecause price declined to 18.52 before rebounding for a week. Patience would\nbe rewarded, though, when prices dropped through support and continued\ndown, triggering the order.\n668\nScallops, Descending",

The descending and inverted scallop looks like an\nupside down J, and prices reach the ultimate low in less than 3 months. It is a\nbearish pattern, meaning that prices break out downward and continue lower.\nAs if this pattern wore glasses, the pattern has trouble reaching the price\ntarget, with less than a third finding the bull’s-eye. I like to see values above\n80%, but that is rare (for any chart pattern). The low success rate suggests\nprice may not decline nearly as far as you hope.\nLike its siblings, there are plenty of surprises with this pattern, most of\nwhich are self-explanatory. However, when several scallops appear in the same\ndownward price trend in a bull market, the scallops tend to get narrower and\nshorter as they appear over time. Thus, if you are considering trading a narrow\nor short scallop that appears after prices have been trending down, do so with\ncaution. The scallop may signal an approaching trend change.\nTour\nWhat does a descending and inverted scallop look like? Figure 44.1 shows a\ntypical example. Prices leading to the pattern trend downward and then bump\nup (from A to B) and round over, forming an inverted bowl. After that, prices\ndrop, usually in a sharp, straight-line decline like that shown from B to C.\nAt the end of the pattern (point C), prices retrace upward forming a sort\nof hook (point D; think of a soup ladle upside down).

For example, the height of the scallop shown in\nFigure 44.4 is the price difference between B and C. The high is at 11.55 and\nthe low is at 8.21, giving a difference of 3.34. Subtract this difference from the\nlow, 8.21, giving a target of 4.87. Price reaches the target less than a month\nafter the breakout.\nWarning: This method works between 27% (bear markets) and 38% (bull\nmarkets) of the time. I consider values over 80% to be reliable, so this method\nfalls well short. Be conservative in your estimates. Is a support zone near the\ntarget? If so, price is more likely to stop there.\nAnother check of the target is to turn it into a percentage decline. In this\nexample, the predicted decline measures 41% (or 3.34/8.21). Since the scallop\npattern in Figure 44.4 is in a bear market, Table 44.3 shows that fewer than\n76% decline by at least 35% (the closest decline to 41%). That suggests the\ntarget is too far away and price is unlikely to decline that far.\nBuy signal. Sell short when price closes below the formation low.

The May scallop looked good, like an inverted\nJ with a smooth top. The bowl height as a percentage of the formation height\nturned out to be 65%, close to the 61.8% Fibonacci number. The ends of the\nformation were clean (meaning a sharp, visible turn) and the pattern looked\nproportional. Most knowledgeable traders would have no trouble spotting this\nscallop. Combined with the April peak (D), it also looked like a double top.\nThe day after price closed below the lowest low in the pattern, he shorted\nit and received a fill at 16. Immediately, he placed a stop just above the pattern\nhigh at 20.05, figuring that it was just above a round number (a common resis-\ntance zone) and just above two minor highs (the scallop top and the earlier peak\nin April).\nPrices slid in a straight-line run, following the slope of the earlier down-\nturn ( January to March), a measured move down pattern that predicted a low\nof about 10. That decline gave him confidence to ride out the small double top\nin June.\nThen earnings came out and the stock gapped downward in mid-July,\nforming another scallop in August. He calculated the price target for this lower\nscallop and saw that it was 4.87. He did not think prices would drop that far,\nbut he monitored it closely, lowering his stop price along the way to capture his\nprofits, just in case.\nPrice reached a low of 4.24 in early October then started rebounding. His\nstop was at 6.35, a few pennies above the minor high in September (E) and just\nabove the early October peak. When price touched his stop, his broker closed\nout the position.\nFrom the buy price of 16 to the stop price of 6.35, he made 60% in about\n5 months of worrying.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select descending scal-\nlops that perform better after the break out.

Actually,\nit is a bit more complicated.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 45.1 shows identification characteristics for 3FP patterns.\nUpward price trend. Since we are looking for three peaks, you are going\nto have to do some counting. Begin counting with the highest high on the\nchart where an upward price trend ends and a stair-step decline begins.\nThree falling peaks. The highest high in each peak must be lower than\nthe prior peak. Allow no ties because we are not searching for double or triple\ntops. The three peaks need not follow a straight down-sloping trend line.\nProportion. The three peaks should appear similar in size and shape. Do\nnot mix a wide and tall peak with a short, one-day spike. Consider Figure 45.2.\nPeaks A1, A2, and A3 appear similar in magnitude. They are all minor highs\nand each peak has a lower top than the one before. Notice that the B peaks are\nmuch smaller in size and shape but distinguishable as three independent peaks,\nnot three peaks born from the same congestion region. Both A1 to A3 and B1\nto B3 are valid three falling peaks patterns.\nThe reason for the rule about proportion is to avoid confusion about peak\nselection. Consider peaks C and D. To me, these look like something I missed\nwith my lawnmower. They are minor highs, as are the other A peaks, but they\nare not in the same league. They are 1- or 2-day spikes that appear out of place\nwith the rounded appearing A1 peak. They are not of the same magnitude or\nproportion. When selecting the three peaks, I ignored C and D and went with\nA1, A2, and A3.\nWhy not select peak E? This peak is robust enough to join the party, so\nyou could call it the third peak. When A3 comes along, you might question the\nvalidity of the A1, A2, E pattern because A3 forms a higher high. The way I\nlooked at the pattern, I liked the idea that you could draw a trend line along the\nA1, A2, and A3 peaks. Having E as the last peak seems out of place.

I have not tested\nthis possibility, but it might lead to better performance.\nConfirmation price. Figure 45.2 shows the confirmation price as a hor-\nizontal line, even with the lowest low. The pattern confirms as a valid pattern\nwhen price closes below the line, usually the valley between the second and last\npeak.

Also, notice how the failure rate climbs for small\nchanges in the maximum price decline. For example, in a bear market, 4% of\nthe 3FP patterns fail to drop more than 5% after the breakout. This percent-\nage climbs to 15% failing to drop more than 10% and doubles to 33% failing\nto decline more than 15%. Thus, the rate quadruples and then doubles, but\nthat rate of increase is typical for many chart pattern types.\nWhat the numbers show is that the decline may not be substantial before\na rebound occurs, because much of the decline has already taken place.

The figure does\nnot show it, but price met the target and continued much lower.\nUnderlying support. Before trading a 3FP, check for underlying support.\nUnderlying support will tell you how far prices are likely to decline. If the mea-\nsure rule predicts a target price near a support zone, then that gives more con-\nfidence that prices will stop near the target. If underlying support is too close to\nthe breakout or too robust, then search for another trade. Prices usually have\nenough power to push through nearby support (those less than 5% away).\nOverhead resistance will tell you how much you stand to lose when things\ngo wrong. Look for a nearby minor high at which to place a stop; just above the\nlowest peak is a good place. If the stop is too far away from the breakout, then\nlook elsewhere for a more promising trade or close the stop distance (move it\ncloser to the breakout).\n694\nThree Falling Peaks\nTable 45.7\nVolume Statistics\nDescription\nBull Market\nBear Market\nRising volume trend performance\n–17%\n–24%\nFalling volume trend performance\n–17%\n–24%\nU-shaped volume pattern performance\n–20%\n–25%\nDome-shaped volume pattern performance\n–16%\n–23%\nNeither U-shaped nor dome-shaped volume pattern \n–17%\n–23%a\nperformance\nHeavy breakout volume performance\n–17%\n–24%\nLight breakout volume performance\n–19%\n–23%\nNote: Minus sign means decline.\naFewer than 30 samples.",

    "text": "Trend-line break. Using this method is similar to early entry trading.\nWhen the lowest low appears between the first two peaks, draw a trend line\nconnecting the two valley lows. A close below the trend line means a downward\nbreakout and time to sell a long position or open a short one. The AB line in\nFigure 45.5 represents the trend line. It must slope upward, like that shown, in\norder to be effective. Disregard down-sloping trend lines and use the lowest\nlow in the pattern as the breakout price.\nWait for confirmation. Wait for a close below the lowest low in the pat-\ntern before trading the 3FP chart pattern. However, ignore this guideline if\nusing the early entry or trend line break as the trading signal. Only when price\ncloses below the lowest low does the pattern become valid. In too many cases\nthat I have seen, the pattern does not confirm and prices shoot upward. A\nshort sale on such a pattern quickly turns into a loss. Always wait for confir-\nmation unless you have a good reason for trading early.\nSample Trade\nConsider how Melody traded the stock shown in Figure 45.5. The day after the\nstock staged an upward breakout from the December–February trading range,\nshe bought, receiving a fill at 20. She did not know that a bear market (in the\nS&P 500 index) would begin in March 2000, a month after she bought. \nNothing along the way worried her about the stock’s performance. She\nviewed the retrace in an uptrend (March and April) when the bear market\nbegan as part of the normal stair-step climb that stocks make. Prices pierced\nanother trading range in May, suggesting continued strength in the stock.\nWhen price peaked at point 1 and dropped to A on high volume, she took\nnotice. Her study of the markets suggested that large price swings on high vol-\nume often mean a trend change. When price made a third lower peak (3), she\ndrew a trend line connecting the two valleys (A and B), forming an up-sloping\ntrend line. The day after price closed below the line, she sold her holdings and\nreceived a fill at 34.27. She made 71% on the trade.\nThe stock continued dropping, reaching a low of 1.02 in early September\n2002, for a decline of 97% below where she sold the stock.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select three falling\npeaks that perform better after the break out.

Entering the trade sooner increases your\nrisk, especially if price was trending down leading to the chart pattern.\nThere are exceptions, of course, and the Trading Tactics section dis-\ncusses them. Figure 46.3 shows an example of when getting in sooner reduces\nyour risk and increases profits. When the peak between valleys 2 and 3 is below\nthe highest high, then the last peak (point A) serves as the new confirmation\nprice. In the example shown in Figure 46.3, that would change a 2%, rise into\na 12% gain. That is not much, but you can make a million bucks by first sav-\ning the pennies.\nFocus on Failures\nThe three rising valleys chart pattern has a small break-even failure rate, but it\nstill fails. Figure 46.3 shows one example. The minor lows marked 1, 2, and 3\nshow rising valleys, each low above the prior one. The minor lows look simi-\nlar in shape, narrow spikes in this case. The pattern confirms when price closes\nabove the highest high.\nWhy did this rising valley fail? I find it valuable to take the big picture and\nzoom in. Since the pattern begins at point 1, I would notice the measured move\ndown pattern marked by turns B and C (the first leg); the corrective phase, C to\nD; and the second down leg, D to 1. After a measured move down, the most\ncommon retrace is a climb back into the corrective phase, C to D. After that, a\nresumption of the original trend (downward in this example) is a good bet.\nSince the corrective phase is a solid block of horizontal price movement,\nit presents a formidable challenge to any price mountaineer willing to attempt\nthe climb. I would not invest in this pattern because of nearby overhead resis-\ntance and the likelihood of price dropping, resuming the downtrend.\nNote point A, the early confirmation price. A close above this peak con-\nfirms the pattern and leads to a gain of 12%, well above the 2% gain measured\nfrom the confirmation line shown in Figure 46.3.\nStatistics\nTable 46.2 shows general statistics for the 3RV pattern.\nNumber of formations.

Active traders, who want to maximize the number of trades each\nyear, should concentrate on trading this pattern in a bull market.\nTable 46.3 shows failure rates for the 3RV pattern. The bull market\nnumbers are lower than the bear market ones. For example, 5% of bull mar-\nket patterns fail to rise at least 5% after the breakout. This figure triples to\n15% failing to rise at least 10%. In a bear market, over half the patterns fail to\nrise at least 20%.\nDespite what appears to be an alarming increase in failures for small price\nmoves, the numbers are quite reasonable when compared to other chart pat-\nterns. Other formations start out with low failure rates, triple, and then double\nfor moves from 5% to 15%. With 3RV, the increase is not as steep.\nWhat do the numbers mean? If your cost of trading is 5% and you want\nto make 15% (20% total), how often does the 3RV pattern fail? Answer: 34%\nin a bull market and 52% in a bear market. The result says two things: Avoid\ntrading this pattern in a bear market and two out of three patterns, on average,\nwill reach your target if you trade them perfectly.\nOf course, you will not trade each one perfectly and your losers will pull\ndown your average gains, so you will have to allow for that.

    "text": "target of 11.66. Price hits the target in early March. The measure rule works\njust 58% of the time in a bull market and only 42% of the time in a bear mar-\nket, so be conservative in your estimates.\nAs a check on the projected gain, turn the height into a percentage move.\nIn this example, the height of 2.14 as a percentage of the high (9.52) would\nmean a rise of 22%. Table 46.3 indicates that about 38% (midway between\n34% and 43%) will fail to rise at least 22% in a bull market. That finding\nmeans 62% will hit the target. If the hit rate gets much lower, then reduce your\ntarget price and look for nearby overhead resistance where price might stall.\nTrade reversals. Price reversals perform better than continuations of\nthe trend in a bull market, because a reversal catches a new trend at its lowest\npoint. Look for underlying support, perhaps a flat base with the 3RV changing\nthe horizontal price movement into an uptrend. Always use stops in case you\nare wrong because calling a trend change in a downtrend is a risky move.\nEarly entry. Usually, the highest high in the pattern marks the breakout\nprice. Sometimes, like that shown in Figure 46.3, the highest high occurs\nbetween the first two valleys. Use the high between the second and third val-\nley as the confirmation price.

Buy when price closes above the down-sloping trend line.\nWait for confirmation. Whichever method you use to determine the\nbreakout price, always wait for confirmation (that is, wait for the breakout).\nMost of the time, a breakout will be a close above the highest high in the pat-\ntern. An early entry or trend-line break also confirms the pattern. Not waiting\nfor confirmation is a game best left to amateurs and novice traders because of\nthe low probability of success.\nSample Trade\nJoshua made the trade shown in Figure 46.4. In late October, he noticed the\n3RV pattern labeled 1, 2, and 3. Since price at point 4 dropped below point 3,\nit made him nervous trading the pattern. However, he liked that price tested\nthe point 1 low (at 4) but rebounded (one of three conditions signaling a trend\nchange; the other two being price pushing up through a down-sloping trend\nline and a close above a prior minor high).\nHe waited to buy the stock until the price direction became clear. At point\n6, he saw the second 3RV chart pattern. Then he noticed the symmetrical trian-\ngle, created by drawing trend lines along the price peaks and valleys. Looking to\nthe left, the rise at 7 connects with the symmetrical triangle to form a diamond.\nHe reviewed the “For Best Performance” list and found that the stock was\nin a bull market (good) with a rising S&P 500 index (good); the breakout was\nin the middle of the yearly price range (bad); he expected a throwback (bad);\nthe pattern was short and wide (the worst possible combination); but volume\nwas rising (good) and it had a U shape (good). The commodity channel index\n(CCI) issued a buy the day before the breakout, but the relative strength index\n(RSI) remained neutral. In short, he faced a mixed technical picture.\nJoshua used the trend-line break method to signal an entry. When price\nclosed above a trend line connecting the two peaks in the pattern, he bought\nand received a fill at 9.20. He used the measure rule to predict a price target\nand came up with 11.66, the same height as the July top (far left). If he sold at\nthat price, he would make 27%. Just below that was a solid line of resistance\nfrom March to May of 1998 (not shown), at a price of 10.80 and rising to\nabout 12. He suspected that the resistance zone would cause a throwback.\nHe put a limit order to sell at 11.47, below the predicted target of 11.66\nand below 11.50, where everyone else would put their orders. If triggered, he\nwould make 25%.\nOver the coming days, he watched the stock reach the resistance zone and\nthen come tumbling down. It completed a throwback in mid-January.

That is one of the reasons\nthe ascending triangle is one of my favorite formations: It can show you where\nthe right place is at the right time. You can make a bundle of money if you\ntrade it properly. But before we get to trading tactics, let us look more closely\nat ascending triangles.\nSince upward breakouts invariably perform better than downward ones,\nthe biggest surprise is that downward breakouts have smaller break-even fail-\nure rates than upward breakouts. The differences are small except for the bear\nmarket when the failure rate is 3%, one quarter the 12% rate of upward break-\nouts. Speaking of failure rates, beginning with the second edition of the Ency-\nclopedia, I count premature breakouts as the actual breakout. In the first edition,\nI ignored them. Thus, the failure rates are now higher and the average rise or\ndecline is smaller. The reason for the change is that traders do not ignore pre-\nmature breakouts because each breakout looks like the real thing. The statis-\ntics now reflect that trading reality.\nTour\nFigure 47.1 shows a good example of an ascending triangle.

    "text": "prices bounce between resistance at the top and support at the bottom. A pre-\nmature breakout gives a hint of the coming action; less than 2 weeks later,\nprices break out again and move higher.\nWhy do ascending triangles form? Imagine you are the manager of a\nlarge mutual fund. Over the years your fund has purchased a few hundred\nthousand shares of the company shown in Figure 47.1. After seeing the stock\nrise for almost a year, you are getting nervous about continuing to hold it. You\nbelieve the stock is trading well above its fair market value and you have spot-\nted a more promising situation in another company.\nYou tell the trading department to dump all your shares as long as it\nreceives at least 18.50. For 2 days, starting on June 4, 1993, the trading depart-\nment sells shares. Since your fund has a large block of shares to get rid of, the\nprice cannot climb much above 18.50 without the fund selling shares and forc-\ning prices back down. The selling puts a ceiling on the stock. Word gets\naround that you are selling and other institutional investors jump on the band-\nwagon and sell too. Their aggressive selling satiates demand and the stock\nstarts declining. It tumbles to a low of 16.25 on June 9, where buying demand\nhalts the decline. Buyers, viewing the price of the stock as a steal, demand\nmore shares.

    "text": "for 3 days. Again, the selling pressure forces prices down and they cross to the\nother side of the now-forming ascending triangle. Prices rebound one last\ntime, and hit the sell zone and stay there for about a week before being turned\naway by excess supply. A call from the trading department confirms that the\nstock has been completely sold.\nWithout an overhanging supply to halt the stock’s rise, prices gap up on\nincreasing demand and soar to 19.25. Your fund is out of the picture, but the\nforces of supply and demand are not finished with the company. Others still\nselling their shares force the stock price back down into the triangle proper.\nPrices race to the other side of the triangle, rebound off the lower trend line,\nthen march back up out the top.\nIf I had to sum up the price action of an ascending triangle, I would say it\nforms because of a supply of shares available at a fixed price. Once the supply\ndepletes, shares quickly break out of the formation and move higher. If\ndemand continues to be strong, prices rise. Otherwise, the stock collapses back\non itself and either regroups for another try or continues down.\nIdentification Guidelines\nFinding an ascending triangle in a chart of daily price data is simple, perhaps too\nsimple. I read a tutorial in a popular magazine in which nearly half the illustra-\ntions purporting to be triangles were incorrectly identified. If you have any\ndoubt about the validity of a chart pattern, others may share those doubts. If\nothers do not see the same shapes you do, chances are the pattern will not work\nas you expect. Under those circumstances, where there is some doubt about cor-\nrect identification, do not trade the formation. Save your money for a trade\nwhere you are sure the formation is valid. I discuss identification problems later\nin this section. For now, Table 47.1 lists ascending triangle characteristics.\nTriangle shape. The triangle pictured in Figure 47.1 is nearly a classic\nexample of an ascending triangle. The horizontal top line of resistance repels\nprices and they rebound off a steadily rising support line below. The two nar-\nrowing lines, one horizontal and the other sloping up, outline a triangular\nshape. The ascending trend line predicts a rise in prices, hence the name\nascending triangle.\nHorizontal top line, up-sloping bottom trend line. The top horizon-\ntal trend line should have prices that approach and withdraw at least twice (in\nother words, two distinct minor highs). Similarly, two distinct minor lows sup-\nport the up-sloping trend line. The two trend lines meet at the triangle apex,\nbut prices usually break out of the formation well before then.\nCrossing pattern. Price should cross the pattern several times, not walk\nalong one of the trend lines. The pattern should look filled with price, not white\nspace. Cutting off a price turn and calling it a triangle is a common selection error.\nVolume. As the triangle forms, volume is heavy at first but tapers off until\nthe day of the breakout. Often volume is abnormally low a few days before the\n714\nTriangles, Ascending",

When the\nbreakout comes, volume can rise substantially and usually does, but heavy vol-\nume on a breakout is not a prerequisite.\nPremature breakouts and breakouts. How can you be sure the break-\nout is not a premature one? You cannot. A premature breakout is a close out-\nside the boundaries of the two trend lines. After a few days, prices return to the\nconfines of the triangle and eventually break out for good by soaring above the\ntop trend line. Volume on premature breakouts is indistinguishable from nor-\nmal breakouts and both occur at about the same distance to the triangle apex.\nPrice action after breakout. Once a triangle has a genuine breakout\nupward, what is the behavior like? Prices rapidly climb away from the triangle\nbut occasionally throw back to the top of the formation. Volume is usually\nheavy, supporting the rise, and continues to be heavy as momentum gathers\nspeed. Once price levels out, volume returns to normal. If price rises over sev-\neral weeks, the volume pattern usually appears erratic and heavy when com-\npared to earlier in the year.\nIdentification Guidelines\n715\nTable 47.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nTriangle shape\nTwo price trend lines, the top one horizontal and the bottom one\nsloping up, form a triangle pattern. The two lines join at the triangle\napex.\nHorizontal top line\nPrices rise up to and fall away from a horizontal resistance line at\nleast twice (two minor highs). Prices need not touch the trend line\nbut should come reasonably close (say, within $0.15). The line need\nnot be completely horizontal but usually is.\nUp-sloping bottom \nPrices decline to and rise away from an up-sloping trend line. Prices\ntrend line\nneed not touch the trend line but should come close (within $0.15).\nAt least two trend line touches (minor lows) are required.\nCrossing pattern\nThis is an important characteristic. Prices should cross the chart\npattern several times; they should not leave a vast amount of white\nspace in the center of the triangle.\nVolume\nVolume is heavier at the start of the formation than near the end.\nVolume is usually low just before the breakout.\nPremature \nSomewhat prone to premature breakouts, both up and down. \nbreakouts\nVolume on a false breakout is also heavy, just as the genuine breakout.\nBreakout\nVolume is heavy (but need not be) and continues to be heavy for\nseveral days.The breakout can be up or down, usually following the\nexisting price trend.\nPrice action after \nOnce prices pierce the horizontal resistance line confirming a break-\nbreakout\nout, prices move away from the formation. Throwbacks to the\nformation top are common. If prices continue to climb rapidly,\nvolume will probably remain high. For downward breakouts,\nvolume is high at first and usually tapers off unless the price decline\nis rapid, in which case volume will probably remain high.",

    "text": "What about support and resistance? If you consider the triangle as the\nmomentary intersection of two trend lines, you can guess where support and\nresistance will be. It will be along the two trend lines. Figure 47.2 shows an\nexample of this pattern on the weekly time scale. Notice the generally down-\nsloping volume trend from the formation start to the week before the breakout.\nVolume spikes upward on the breakout and then generally declines as prices\nround over and approach 1994. Prices start climbing again, essentially hugging\nthe trend line started by the ascending triangle. The upward trend continues\nfor several years following the triangle-initiated support line. Although the\nmatch between the sloping trend line and the slope of the later price action is\nnot exact, the trend is clear. The triangle sports two minor high touches of the\ntop trend line and three on the bottom, numbered in the figure. Trend-line\ntouches and prices crossing the triangle are important selection criteria.\nBy now you may feel comfortable with correctly identifying an ascending\ntriangle. However, there are some situations that may fool investors new to the\nformation. Figure 47.3 shows the first one. Cover up the right half of the fig-\nure and ask yourself if what you see on the left looks like an ascending triangle.\nThe horizontal line, drawn to rest on top of the central peak, extends to the left\nand right until it intersects prices. Although the lower trend line has several\ninstances where prices decline to and bounce off of the up-sloping line, the top\ntrend line does not have such a situation.\nLooking at the right side of the chart, does this still look like an ascend-\ning triangle?

    "text": "Focus on Failures\nFigure 47.5 shows the first failure type: a 5% failure. Strictly speaking this is\nnot a 5% failure (because price climbs by 6%), but it is typical of what one\nlooks like. A 5% failure is when price breaks out and moves less than 5%\nhigher before curling around and moving below the formation low. In this\ncase, price leaves the formation at 6.13 and reaches a high of 6.50—a 6% move.\nMost failures of this type have two causes. The first is overhead resistance,\nand it is easy to spot. Look for peaks or valleys sharing a common price or a\nsolid block of horizontal price movement. Chart patterns, trend lines, and\nother technical patterns also set up resistance zones. Before investing in a pat-\ntern, always check for overhead resistance.\nThe second cause of failure is when the general market swings against the\nbreakout direction. If the breakout is upward and the market turns down, that\nmay be enough to kill a profitable trade. The same can happen with stocks in\nthe same industry. If competitor’s stocks are going down and yours is the lone\nholdout, chances are your stock will join the party and tank as well.

I looked at 1,092 triangles using 500 stocks\nfrom mid-1991 to mid-1996, and 500 stocks mostly from 2000 to 2003 (the\nbear market) but included additional patterns between those two periods.\nReversal or continuation. Upward breakouts act as reversals of the\ndownward price trend and downward breakouts act as continuations. The\nnumbers are close enough that one behavior does not dominate the other\n(reversals make up 53% of the triangle population and continuations 47%).\nTriangles with upward breakouts acting as trend reversals outperform, some-\ntimes significantly, and in downward breakouts, continuations outperform but\nby a slight degree.\nAverage rise or decline. The numbers in this row are, well, average\nwhen compared to other chart pattern types. The best and worst performance\ncomes during a bull market. Upward breakouts climb 35% (the best perfor-\nmance) and downward ones drop just 19% (the worst performance). Remem-\nber that I include premature breakouts as regular breakouts, so that partly\naccounts for the lower performance numbers. Note that the best performance\ncomes when prices follow the market trend: upward breakouts in bull markets\nand downward breakouts in bear markets.\nRises or declines over 45%. Upward breakouts perform well, as over a\nquarter rise more than 45%. Downward breakouts suffer using this measure, so\nthe poor showing is expected.\nChange after trend ends. Once price reaches the ultimate high or low,\nit drops about 30% (after the ultimate high) and climbs about 50% (after the\nultimate low). The numbers show how much you can make if you successfully\ntrade a trend change.\nBusted pattern performance. Busted patterns are easy to spot as prices\nmove less than 5% from the breakout before returning to the triangle and\nshooting out the other side. When that happens, trade in the direction of the\nnew trend.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change. Compare the market numbers with the\naverage rise or decline. When the market is bullish, that helps upward break-\nouts and hurts downward ones. Bearish market numbers have the same impact.\nThe numbers suggest you trade with the market trend: upward breakouts in a\nbull market and downward breakouts in a bear market. Countertrend trades\noften lead to disappointing results.\nDays to ultimate high or low. Upward breakouts take longer to reach\nthe ultimate high than downward breakouts take to reach the ultimate low.\nThe implication of this finding is that the bear market is steeper than is the rise\nin a bull market. For example, the 24% decline in a bear market takes 39 days.\nIf the decline measured 35% (the same as the rise in a bull market), it should\ntake 57 days not 185 as it did in a bull market. Thus, the decline in a bear mar-\nket is steeper but shorter.\nTable 47.3 shows failure rates for ascending triangles.

Still, it is one quarter the 12% rate of upward breakouts (103 samples).\nBest explained by examples, you read the table as follows: About a third\n(32%) of ascending triangles with upward breakouts in a bull market fail to\nclimb at least 15% after the breakout. Half (50%) fail to rise 25%. For down-\nward breakouts, the bear market does best with just 3% failing to decline at\nleast 5% after the breakout. Over half (52%) fail to drop more than 25%.\nNotice how the failure rates climb for small changes in the maximum\nprice rise or decline. The rates double or triple and then move up again, but\nnot so dramatically, for maximum price moves from 5% to 10% and on to\n15%. Such high increases are typical for all chart pattern types.\nCompare the failure rates of bull market, upward breakouts with its com-\nplement, bear market, downward breakouts. Above 15%, the bull market takes\nover and shows a lower failure rate.\nWhat do the numbers mean? Although most of the failure rates start\nhigh, they do not increase as fast as other chart patterns (which typically triple\nand then double for moves up to 15%). If you expect a large price move, hope\nthat the pattern shows an upward breakout in a bull market for the best per-\nformance. For small moves, triangles with downward breakouts in a bear mar-\nket do best.

Most of the time, ascending triangles\nwill show breakouts about 62% of the way to the apex.\nTable 47.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Many of the triangles with poor performance flame out early, usually in\nthe first week or two. For example, 38% of the triangles with downward break-\nouts in a bear market will reach the ultimate low in less than 2 weeks.

    "text": "Trading Tactics\nNow that you can identify ascending triangles and know their behavior, how\ndo you trade them? Before I give an example of a trade, I discuss trading tac-\ntics and the measure rule (see Table 47.8).\nMeasure rule. The shape of the ascending triangle suggests prices will\nrise, but how far? If you compute the height of the formation and add the result\nto the price of the horizontal trend line, the result is the minimum predicted\nprice. This is called the measure rule. For downward breakouts, subtract the\ntriangle height from the breakout price to get the target.\nAn example makes the calculation clear for upward breakouts. Consider\nthe stock shown in Figure 47.6. Calculate the height of the formation by sub-\ntracting the low (14.38 at the first minor low) from the high (17.63 denoted by\nthe horizontal trend line) at the formation start. The difference is 3.25. Add the\nresult to the highest high—the value of the horizontal trend line—and you get\na target price of 20.88. Prices reach the target in mid-July 1992, when they\nclimb to a high of 21.63, about 6 weeks after the upward breakout.\nA more visual approach is to draw a line from the start of the formation\n(the top left corner) parallel to the up-sloping trend line. The value of the line\nthe day price breaks out of the formation becomes the target price. The figure\nshows the new line. Be careful when determining where the formation begins\nTrading Tactics\n725\nTable 47.7\nVolume Statistics\nBull\nBear\nBull\nBear\nMarket,\nMarket,\nMarket,\nMarket,\nUp\nUp\nDown\nDown\nDescription\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nRising volume trend performance\n39%\n28%a\n–16%\n–26%a\nFalling volume trend performance\n34%\n31%\n–20%\n–24%\nU-shaped volume pattern \nperformance\n35%\n36%\n–20%\n–25%a\nDome-shaped volume pattern \nperformance\n35%\n30%\n–19%\n–23%\nNeither U-shaped nor dome-shaped \nvolume pattern performance\n39%\n19%a\n–16%a\n–27%a\nHeavy breakout volume performance\n37%\n33%\n–18%\n–24%\nLight breakout volume performance\n32%\n22%a\n–20%\n–26%\nNote: Minus sign means decline.\naFewer than 30 samples.",

However,\nhe would also give up part of his gains because the fastest portion of the rise\noccurs at the start. That was a trade-off he was willing to make.\nDan took an interest in the company shown in Figure 47.7 when he\nnoticed an ascending triangle forming in the stock. He believed that the break-\nout was nearly at hand when volume collapsed to 23,400 shares on August 19.\nTwo days later, on higher volume, prices crossed the triangle and peaked out\nthe top. For the next few days, prices balanced themselves on the top horizon-\ntal trend line and waited for demand to send them higher. The decisive break-\nout occurred on August 26, even though volume was tepid. Dan grabbed his\ncalculator and computed the breakout distance to the apex and discovered that\nthe breakout occurred at the 70% mark. This percentage signaled a potentially\nstrong breakout.\nHowever, volume told a different story. Although volume had been\nsteadily receding throughout the formation as one would expect, there was not\nenthusiastic volume on the breakout. With this stealthy signal, Dan decided to\nwait before buying the stock.\nBelieving that a profitable opportunity was at hand, he computed the tar-\nget price to see if it afforded a profitable move.

That is when Dan pulled the trigger and bought 500\nshares at the high for the day, 19.50 (point 1 on Figure 47.7). Immediately, he\nplaced a stop-loss order to sell the stock should it decline 0.15 below the low-\nest low of the formation. That would limit his loss to a steep 15%, but it was\nalso slightly below the nearest support level (the bottom of which was at 16.75).\nHe reasoned that there was a decent chance that if the stock declined, growing\ndemand would repulse prices and not trigger his stop.\nThen he waited and watched the stock. It peaked at 21.25 on September\n26 before leveling off and heading back down. Since the stock was not near the\nprice target of 22.50, Dan decided to hold on.

Normally, volume\nrecedes as the breakout approaches, but this one appears to have a U-shaped\ntrend—higher at the beginning and end, and weaker in the center. The break-\nout is downward and occurs on low volume. A bearish breakout can have high\nor low volume but volume is usually heavy.

    "text": "Why do descending triangles form? The descending triangle shown in\nFigure 48.1 begins forming in October 1994 as part of a consolidation in a\ndownward trend. Imagine you believe the fair value of this stock is 7.38 but is\novervalued at prices much above that. You tell your broker to buy the stock\nshould it fall to 7.38. After reaching a minor high at 8.38 on October 11, the\nstock begins declining for a few days. It descends and reaches the buy price 2\ndays later. Your broker buys the stock.\nYou are not alone. Other investors, believing the stock is retesting the low\nthat occurred a week earlier, also buy the stock. Together, the buying puts a\nmomentary floor on the stock. For the next 2 days, the stock returns to the 7.38\nlevel before buying demand pushes the price higher. This time the stock does\nnot climb as high as the prior minor high; it only reaches a value of 8.13 before\nturning down. Again, when the stock reaches a low of 7.38, buying demand\nincreases enough to halt the decline at that level and to send the stock moving\nback up. During the next 2 weeks or so, you and other investors buy the stock.\nEnthusiasm for the stock quickly wanes and a series of lower highs outline a\ndown-sloping trend. The floor, at 7.38, becomes the horizontal support level.\nEventually, investors buy enough of the stock and have either run out of\nmoney to buy more or decide they already own enough. The stock slips below\nthe support line on November 9, and closes at the low for the day at 7.13. The\nstock hovers near that price for a few more days before continuing down in\nearnest on higher volume.\n732\nTriangles, Descending\nFilene’s Basement Corp (Retail (Special Lines), NASDAQ, BSMT)\nLow Volume\nBreakout\nPullback\nJan 95\nFeb\nMar\nSep 94\nOct\nNov\nDec\n \n– 11\n \n– 10\n \n– 9\n \n– 8\n \n– 7\n \n– 6\n \n– 5\n \n– 4\n \n– 3\n \n– 2\nFigure 48.1\nA nicely formed descending triangle with unusual volume pattern.\nTypically, volume trends downward and is quite low just before the breakout.

A descending triangle\nappears during March and April 1993 and marks the end of a long rise started\nin late 1992.

Although the second formation is a failure because it rises above the\ntriangle top, prices do start down within the month. Sometimes failed forma-\ntions prematurely alert you to a trend change, as the July example shows.\nTable 48.1 outlines the identification characteristics for descending\ntriangles.\nTriangle shape. The triangular-shaped appearance makes the descend-\ning triangle pattern easy to identify. Look for two trend lines: the bottom one\nhorizontal, or nearly so, and the top one sloping down. The two trend lines\nshould eventually join at the triangle apex, but price usually breaks out before\nreaching it.\nHorizontal support line. Price rebounds off the bottom of the forma-\ntion creating a horizontal trend line. This imaginary line acts as support for the\nstock. Once price closes below the line, it resists any upward move. Look for\nat least two touches of the horizontal trend line. The touches should be distinct\nminor lows, not part of the same consolidation region.\nDown-sloping top trend line. Prices oscillate up and down, with each\nwave getting smaller, and the tops of these waves following a down-sloping\ntrend line. The trend line acts as a layer of resistance. Look for at least two\ntouches of the top trend line, both from minor highs, not as part of the same\ncongestion region.\nVolume. Volume typically recedes over the course of triangle develop-\nment. As price approaches the breakout, it usually becomes quite low, as if\ngathering strength before a wrestling match, and then explodes upward during\n734\nTriangles, Descending\nTable 48.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nTriangle shape\nA triangular-shaped pattern bounded by two trend lines, the\nbottom one horizontal and the top one sloping down, that\nintersect at the triangle apex.\nHorizontal support \nA horizontal (or nearly so) base acts to support prices. Prices \nline\nshould touch the base at least twice (at least two minor lows\nthat either touch or come close to the trend line).\nDown-sloping top \nA down-sloping price trend that eventually intersects the hori-\ntrend line\nzontal base line at the apex. Prices should rise up and touch (or\ncome close to) the sloping trend line at least twice, forming two\ndistinct minor highs.\nVolume\nVolume recedes and tends to drop off just before the breakout.\nBreakouts\nUsually occur on very high volume that diminishes over time.\nHowever, prices can also break out on low volume.\nPrice action after \nPrices usually move down quickly, reaching the ultimate low in a \nbreakout\nstraight-line fashion.

    "text": "the breakout. Volume need not be high during the breakout or low preceding\nthe breakout, but that is the typical behavior. Do not exclude a descending tri-\nangle just because volume looks unusual.\nBreakouts. Price can break out in any direction, including none at all\nwhen price just meanders out the triangle apex. If you were to trade descend-\ning triangles often enough, you would find that two out of three break out\ndownward. However, the breakout direction follows the prior price trend half\nthe time, meaning sometimes it acts as a reversal and sometimes not.\nPrice action after breakout. About half the time, price returns to the\nbreakout price through either a throwback (upward breakout) or pullback (down-\nward breakout), taking less than 2 weeks to complete the trip. After that, anything\ncan happen. Usually, however, price returns to moving in the original breakout\ndirection but sometimes not—just to frustrate the largest number of traders.\nSupport and resistance appear along the two trend lines. Throwbacks to\nthe top of the formation usually stop at the sloping trend line, whereas pull-\nbacks to the bottom halt at the horizontal trend line. After a breakout, prices\noften follow the sloping trend line down. During the recovery process after a\ndescending triangle, prices rise to meet the level of the horizontal trend line\nand then pause. Sometimes it takes several tries before prices push up through\nthe horizontal resistance line.\nTriangles, as a group, are easy to spot. However, there are some situations\nthat dictate a careful approach. Figure 48.3 shows an example of what looks like\nIdentification Guidelines\n735\nCrompton and Knowles Co.

In Figure 48.3 volume rises along with prices at the start\nof the triangle and then tapers off at the top when prices round over. However,\nvolume climbs as prices descend and then ignites the day after the breakout.\nVolume for many formations is not a crucial factor, and you should not\nattach too much significance to it. However, a volume pattern that is not char-\nacteristic raises a warning flag. Coupled with other factors, it might cause you\nto bypass the stock and look elsewhere for a more promising situation.\nThe price picture is even worse.

    "text": "failure (because some traders will put a stop above the triangle top to prevent\na catastrophic loss). The climb does not end there as price forms into a pennant\nwith an upward breakout. That pennant, being a half-staff pattern, suggests a\nclimb that equals the one leading to it. In this example, the rise is more than the\npreceding one.\nWhat went wrong with this triangle? The price trend leads downward\ninto the pattern and many traders would expect a downward breakout, but the\ntriangle forms in the midst of a bull market. In a rising general market (that is,\nthe S&P 500 index is moving up), a downward breakout is always a red flag. In\nfact, the S&P was on a straight uphill run leading into August and then the\ntrend reversed. For about 2 weeks, prices declined and formed a bottom, then\na higher bottom, and then a third higher low. The three rising valleys signaled\na trend change and doomed the downward breakout from the triangle.\nBesides the market tide robbing the triangle ship of momentum, the tri-\nangle looks almost perfect. Prices touch each trend line several times, crossing\nthe triangle and leaving no white space, but volume tends to rise instead of\nrecede. The two minor lows near the start of the triangle do not rest on the\nhorizontal trend line. If you were to connect those two lows with a new hori-\nzontal trendline, the breakout would have come a bit sooner, but you still\nwould have lost money if you shorted the stock.\nIn the summer of 1995 and into the fall (not shown), several peaks appeared\nnear $13. These peaks acted as support and played a role in stopping the\ndecline. The underlying support coupled with a rising stock market truncated\nthe decline and turned a handsome descending triangle into an ugly loser.\nStatistics\nTable 48.2 shows general statistics for descending triangles.\nNumber of formations. I dug up 1,166 descending triangles; most came\nfrom 500 stocks between mid-1991 and 1996. Another 500 stocks I used from\n2000 to 2003, to encompass the bear market. The remainder of the patterns\ncame between those dates as I found them in my daily trading activities.\nReversal or continuation. If you add the numbers, you will find that the\npattern acts as a reversal 592 times and as a continuation of the prevailing price\ntrend 574 times. Thus, descending triangles are as likely to act as continuations\nas they are reversals. Do not depend on the breakout direction continuing the\ntrend leading to the pattern.\nWhen the breakout direction agrees with the market trend (bull market,\nupward breakout or bear market, downward breakout), reversals tend to per-\nform better than continuations.\nAverage rise or decline. Triangles in bull markets with upward break-\nouts are the stars, scoring a 47% rise after the breakout. Downward breakouts\nin a bear market also do well, with declines of 25%.

In a bear market, be ready to exit a trade quickly.\nTable 48.3 shows failure rates for descending triangles. Triangles with\nupward breakouts in a bull market have the lowest break-even failure rate: 7%.\nDownward breakouts have the highest rate of failure.\nHow do you make sense of the numbers? Consider the 15% maximum\nprice rise or decline row. Over half of the triangles with downward breakouts\nin a bull market drop less than 15%. That is a huge failure rate. Upward break-\nouts, by contrast, show just 20% failing to rise at least 15%.\nNotice how the failure rates skyrocket for small changes in the maximum\nprice. For example, triangles with downward breakouts in a bear market start\nwith an 11% failure rate.

    "text": "Trading Tactics\nTable 48.8 shows trading tactics for descending triangles.\nMeasure rule. As you would expect, the measure rule tries to predict the\nvalue to which prices decline after a downward breakout. Compute the height\nof the formation by subtracting the price of the lower trend line from the high-\nest high in the triangle. Then, subtract the height from the value of the lower\nhorizontal trend line (downward breakouts) or add it to the breakout price\n(upward breakout). The result is the target price.\nCompute the height of the triangle shown in Figure 48.5 by taking the\ndifference between the highest high and lowest low (marked by the black dots).\nThe value is 1.44 (that is, 8.82 – 7.38). Subtract the height from the value of the\nhorizontal trend line, or 7.38 – 1.44, giving a predicted price decline to 5.94.\nPrices reach the target the day of the breakout. Since the measure rule suggests\nthe minimum price move, the final decline is often larger. In this case, the stock\nreached a low of 4.69 in mid-April 1994 for a total decline of 36%.\nAn alternative approach, which eliminates the cumbersome math, is to\ndraw a line parallel to the down-sloping trend line starting at the lower left cor-\nner of the formation. The value of the line where prices break out of the for-\nmation becomes the target price.\nWait for confirmation. Waiting for a breakout to occur is paramount\nsince the direction is unknown ahead of time.

    "text": "always short after a pullback. A pullback is also a good time to add to your short\nposition. Wait for prices to resume falling before shorting. Cover your position\nwhen prices approach the target price or until the picture changes (either fun-\ndamentally or technically).\nSell on downward breakout. Since a downward breakout can take prices\nlower rapidly, the pullback typically allows you to enter the trade at a higher\nprice than if you bought the day after a downward breakout. If the stock fails\nto pull back, look elsewhere for another opportunity. Do not chase the stock\ndown should a pullback not occur. If the stock declines and you still decide to\nshort the position, then you are probably entering near the low and setting\nyourself up for a disappointment.\nCover on measure rule. If you are long the stock and are an intermediate-\nor long-term holder and you do not want to suffer through such a decline\n(which could go much lower than the 16% to 25% average), consider selling the\nstock on the downward breakout and buying it back after it fulfills the measure\nrule. Remember, the measure rule suggests a minimum price move and yet\nprices meet the target only half of the time. In other words, if you sell the stock,\nit might not decline as far as you expect.\nSample Trade\nJacob is a novice investor. He has an MBA and works in the insurance indus-\ntry, which has acclimated him to risk. Still, shorting a stock is not his first\nchoice. The stock shown in Figure 48.6 interested him. A few days before the\nbreakout, he ran through the qualifiers. The volume trend looked good: gen-\nerally downward as you would expect until a few weeks before the breakout\nwhen it deviated from the normal pattern. The number of touches from side to\nside was good, and the minor highs and lows were distinct. He concluded that\nthis was a valid descending triangle in the making.\nJacob was nervous about shorting the stock since it could turn around and\nclimb away from him, but a stop placed at the top of the triangle would limit\nhis risk if things did not work out. Still, he was uncomfortable shorting and\nreally wanted to own the stock at a lower price. He decided to buy the stock\nafter it fulfilled the measure rule.\nHe computed the height of the triangle and discovered that the minimum\ndownward move would take the stock to 12.50. As Jacob watched the stock\neach day, he saw it break out downward and begin declining. The first time it\nreached the target price and recovered a bit, he suspected the stock was near its\nlow. At least, that is what he hoped.\nOn October 19, 1992, Jacob bought 200 shares of the stock at the close of\n12.50, exactly the target price he predicted earlier. He placed a stop-loss order\nat 11.13, slightly below the prior December’s low of 11.25, a support level.\nThen, he looked at the possible reward and believed the stock would rise to its\nold high of 17. He sat back and waited.\nSample Trade\n745",

    "text": "It didn’t take long for the stock to bottom out and start its climb. In mid-\nNovember, Jacob hoped the trend was the beginning of a measured move up.\nHe calculated the difference from the low near where he bought the stock to\nthe most recent high and came up with a value of 2.63. He added this to the\ncurrent closing price and computed a new target price of 17.50. This number\nwas quite close to his original price target of 17.\nOver the next few days, the stock started moving up again. By early Decem-\nber it had hit his new price target and the measured move was complete. Jacob\ndecided to raise his stop-loss point to 16, the top of a support layer. If the stock\nsold at 16, he would have a gain of 28%, a respectable return. The results pleased\nhim so far, but he worried that prices would hit his stop as the stock consolidated.\nJust after the new year the stock started climbing again and he held on for\nthe ride. He kept raising his stop until he was taken out at 23, to which the\nstock declined in mid-February 1993.

Although prices touch\nboth trend lines several times, there is too much white space filling the center\nof the formation.\nFigure 49.5 shows the second type of failure, and it is what I call a 5% fail-\nure because price fails to continue moving in the breakout direction by more\nthan 5% before reversing. The figure shows a well-formed symmetrical trian-\ngle during February and March with two minor highs and three minor lows, all\nof them touching (or coming close to) their respective trend lines. The two\ntrend lines intersect and the formation stands alone. By that, I mean it is not\npart of another formation. Or is it? The left peak in conjunction with the first\nminor high in the triangle might mark the beginning of a double top (or, if you\ninclude the second, lower, peak in January, it might be a triple top). Since prices\ndo not fall below the lowest low between the two peaks before reaching a higher\nhigh, the formation does not confirm and is not a double (or triple) top.\nHowever, the higher high forming as part of the throwback to the trian-\ngle apex (late March) could extend the double top into a larger triple top. Once\nprices tumble below the low formed between the three peaks, a triple top is\n754\nTriangles, Symmetrical\nTesoro Petroleum (Petroleum (Integrated), NYSE, TSO)\nToo Much White Space\nMay 95\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\n \n– 12\n \n– 11\n \n– 10\n \n– 9\n \n– 8\n \n– 7\n \n– 6\n \n– 5\nA\nC\nB\nFigure 49.4\nAn invalid symmetrical triangle.

As you can see in the table, many symmetrical triangles take over 70 days\nto reach the ultimate high or low. However, a large portion reach their end\nmoves in the first week. In fact, about a quarter of the up breakout triangles and\nover a third of the down breakout ones will reverse course in week 1.\nTriangles with downward breakouts show a slight rise in the numbers\nduring week 3 (21 days).

    "text": "move up or down formation). Had the triangle broken out downward, it might\nhave continued down and fulfilled the measure rule. In such a case, the mea-\nsure from point C (on the left at 11.88) to point A should be subtracted from\nthe value of point B. The result is the target price of 6.25. Point C is the start\nof the move leading to the triangle and the measure rule applies just as in a\nmeasured move up or down formation.\nUse one or both measure rules as appropriate to the situation. The first\nmethod, using the formation height, is the more conservative of the two and\nmore likely to be fulfilled.\nTrade with trend. It is difficult or impossible to determine in which\ndirection price will break out. Generally, it continues the prevailing trend.\nEven in Figure 49.6, although the formation acts as a short-term reversal of the\ndownward trend, the longer-term trend is upward (not shown in the figure). \nWait for breakout. Always wait for a breakout. Occasionally, price\nsqueezes out the triangle apex and has no breakout at all. This is a rarity, but it\ndoes happen. Once price breaks out, trade with the trend: Go long if price\nbreaks out upward and short on downward breakouts.\nTrade busted patterns. I have noticed that even when price breaks out\nin an adverse direction (a reversal of the prevailing trend), it quickly reverses\nagain and resumes the original trend. This means, for example, in an upward\ntrend price breaks out downward and falls by 5%, then heads back up and fin-\nishes much higher. Figures 49.2 and 49.3 show examples. This behavior for\nreversals is something to watch out for, especially for downward breakouts in\na raging bull market. Trading these busted patterns can be profitable.\nIntrapattern trade. Another way of trading triangles is to buy near the\nlower trend line, sell near the upper one, and then go short. Occasionally, a\nsymmetrical triangle is tall enough and long enough that you can profitably\ntrade it in this manner, but you have to be nimble. If you are inexperienced, be\nsure to practice this on paper before trying it with real money.\nSample Trade\nCan you make money on symmetrical triangles? Yes. Consider the trade I made\nin the stock shown in Figure 49.6. There were a number of factors that led me\nto this stock, including a rising rig count, rising oil prices, cold weather, and\nrelated political events (OPEC tightening and possible oil boycott against Nige-\nria). All of these factors suggested the price of oil during the winter would con-\ntinue rising and demand for the oil field services industry would remain strong.\nAnother factor was that the stock price was riding along the bottom of a\ntrend channel. The method used to create the trend channel is somewhat com-\nplicated but it involves drawing a line using linear regression on the closing\nprices and then plotting two lines parallel to the regression line, each two stan-\n762\nTriangles, Symmetrical",

In a bear market, the results are about what you would expect\nfrom a bullish pattern in a bear market.\nAlmost two out of three triple bottoms will throw back, so consider that\nbefore you trade. If price continues down after the throwback, then your trade\nmay well end up with a loss. If it rebounds, the numbers suggest that perfor-\nmance will suffer. In other words, the best performers are triple bottoms with-\nout throwbacks.\nAnother surprise is that narrow patterns perform better than wide ones.\nUsually, width is not a good indicator of performance but height is. The reason\nfor that unusual behavior is unclear. Of one thing I am certain, triple bottoms\nin a bear market act differently than those in a bull market. Often the results are\nopposite. For example, when the last bottom is above the middle bottom, per-\nformance excels in a bull market but underperforms in a bear market.\nTour\nFigure 50.1 shows an example of a triple bottom. Prices descend to the 37 area\nthree times and each time, they turn away; the level marks a zone of support\npreventing future declines. The sharp V-shaped recession, especially during the\nlast valley, is typical for triple bottoms.

    "text": "The price level of the three valleys is nearly the same, in this case, within\n$0.38 of one another. That feature is a key element of triple bottoms as we see\nin the Identification Guidelines section.\nEach chart formation is unique with characteristics that distinguish it\nfrom other patterns, and the one in Figure 50.1 is no exception. The stock\nreaches a low in mid-October 1992, after trending down for 5 months. Then\nprices retrace their losses and stray into new high territory before heading\ndown to the first triple bottom low. Support reached during formation of the\nfirst low is set up by the peak back in May 1992. Prices climb to the 37 area sev-\neral times from January to May but fail to burst through the resistance.\nThe multiple hits on the ceiling are in no small measure responsible for the\nsupport the triple bottom encounters. As prices descend to 37, investors willing\nto part with their shares at the lower level are scarce. When someone does offer\nto sell, buyers snatch the stock believing they are getting a good bargain. They\nare right. Prices do not meander at the 37 level for long. If you look closely at\nFigure 50.1, each valley floor is a 1-day downward spike, albeit small but visible.\nThe start of the formation, from the first to the second bottom, looks like\na broadening top, right-angled and ascending, with its horizontal bottom and\nup-sloping top trend line. However, there are not enough price crossings to\nvalidate the formation. It always makes me nervous when I see plenty of white\nspace in a formation (such as that shown between the first and second bot-\ntoms). When the rise between the second and third troughs fails to come any-\nwhere near the up-sloping trend line, the jig is up.\nPrices stop rising at the same point, about 46, making the triple bottom\nlook like a double top. This pattern, too, fails to come to fruition when prices\nreach the 37 support zone and turn around. The double top remains uncon-\nfirmed and it just becomes another two bumps on the price chart.\nPrice eventually punches through the overhead resistance and continues\nhigher, following a near straight-line run. In this example, the triple bottom\nacts as a consolidation of the uptrend.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 50.1 outlines the guidelines for identifying triple bottoms.\nThree bottoms, price. I think most technical analysts will tell you that\nnot any three bottoms will do for a triple bottom. The three bottoms are usu-\nally large and well separated with generally rounded rises in between. The\nlowest price in each bottom is at about the same level. If the center price is\nlower than the other two, then you might be looking at a head-and-shoulders\nbottom. When the bottoms are successively lower in price, it might be one of\nthe broadening series of formations.\nVolume. The volume trend usually recedes over the course of the for-\nmation.

    "text": "high reached during the chart pattern. It serves as the breakout point, the point\nto which price must rise before any three minor lows become a true triple bot-\ntom. When price rises above the confirmation line, the formation confirms and\nprice should continue rising.\nYou can see in Figure 50.2 that the three bottoms are at nearly the same\nprice. Only the last bottom falls short of the goal. As we see in the Statistics\nsection, this often signals a better performing formation. This triple bottom is\nthe beginning of a large, extended move that takes prices from a low of 34.50\nto a high of 73.50 in 16 months.\nThe volume trend in this formation is downward with the largest con-\ncentration of high volume on the first bottom. The center bottom has subdued\nvolume and is even lower on the third bottom in early October. Volume spikes\nupward as price rises to the confirmation point in mid-November.\nWeekly chart. Triple bottoms are usually large enough to be visible on\nweekly charts.\nFocus on Failures\nOnce price reaches the confirmation line, it usually has been rising for about a\nmonth, on average, since the third bottom. Price often pierces the resistance line\nbut doubles back, hesitating before continuing up—most of the time. In some\ncases, price rises above the confirmation point by less than 5% before throwing\nback and continuing down. When that happens, it is called a 5% failure. In this\nstudy of triple bottoms, all chart patterns must stage an upward breakout (a rise\nabove the highest high in the formation) before being labeled a triple bottom.\nSince all formations have upward breakouts, only 5% failures remain to wipe the\nwarm glow of a successful investment from a novice investor’s face. Fortunately,\n5% failures are rare. Figure 50.3 shows an example of such a failure.\nThe formation is a triple bottom since price rises above the confirmation\nline in mid-September. But the rise is brief—only 1 day has a close above the\nconfirmation line before price tumbles.\nWhat are the signs of a budding failure? In this situation, the curved rise\nleading to the triple bottom suggests a rounding top. The volume pattern is\nsuspiciously flat, but an irregular or abnormal pattern is common and should\nnot automatically disqualify a formation. Perhaps the most likely failure is not\none of performance but of identification. Are the three bottoms well separated,\neach a significant minor low in its own right? Are the low prices near to one\nanother without the center bottom being meaningfully below the other two?\nAs you look at the formation, it should take on a striking appearance and\nalmost shout, “Yes, I am a triple bottom!” There should be something familiar,\na special quality that distinguishes a valid triple bottom from any other three-\nlump configuration. If it does not scream, “Buy me!” then you should probably\nlook elsewhere.\nFocus on Failures\n769",

The measure rule predicts the minimum price move. To\nuse it, subtract the lowest low from the highest high reached in the formation\nand then add the difference to the highest high. The result is the expected min-\nimum price move. For example, consider the triple bottom shown in Figure\n50.4. The lowest low occurs on the first bottom at 21.25. Price reaches the\nhighest high during the rally from the first bottom to the second. The confir-\nmation point is the highest high in the formation because price must rise above\nthis level before the formation confirms as a true triple bottom. In this exam-\nple, the confirmation point is 25.75. The difference between the high and the\nlow, 4.50, is the formation height.

I love those mountains, but triple tops are another\nmatter. As bearish patterns, they predict a price downturn and that is never a\ngood omen for traders holding the stock.\nThe low failure rate in a bear market (5%) plus the average decline (24%)\nmake triple tops a solid performer.

Price piercing the neck-\nline seals the fate of the stock. Price tumbles in a straight-line fashion until\nreaching a low of 37, a decline from the triple top high of 50.\nThe three peaks of the triple top form at about 50 and have two valleys\nbetween them. The lowest valley low marks the confirmation point, the level to\nwhich prices must decline to confirm the validity of the formation. After con-\nfirmation, prices usually pull back to the confirmation point before stumbling.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 51.1 outlines identification guidelines for triple tops.\nThree large distinct tops. When searching for a triple top or verifying\nthat the three bumps on a price chart belong to the formation, look at the high-\nest high in each peak. The peaks should be near one another in price. A center\npeak that towers above the other two suggests the pattern is a head-and-shoul-\nders top. When the tops consistently inch upward, the activity suggests a broad-\nening top. While looking at the three peaks, do not ignore the lows. The\nformation may be a right-angled descending broadening top or even a descend-\ning broadening wedge if the three peaks are moving down slightly in price.\nIdentification Guidelines\n781\nTable 51.1\nIdentification Characteristics \nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nThree large distinct tops\nLook for three minor highs, well separated and distinct. The\ntall peaks are often sharp spikes that contrast with more\nrounding-appearing valleys.\nSame price\nThe price variation among the three tops is minor. The\ncenter top should not be significantly above the other two,\notherwise it is a head-and-shoulders top. There is a\ntendency for smaller triple tops to be one of the\nbroadening family of chart patterns, especially the right-\nangle variety, so pay attention to the price lows, too.\nDownward volume \nThe volume trend is usually downward but may be hard to \ntrend\nread. Often the volume pattern is flat except near each of\nthe three peaks. The first peak often has the highest volume.\nConfirmation point\nPrices must decline below the lowest low in the formation\n(the confirmation point) or it is not a triple top. An up-\nsloping trend line drawn connecting the valley lows can\nalso serve as confirmation. \nWeekly chart\nSince triple tops are usually large price formations, look at\nthe weekly chart to help identify the longer variety.",

    "text": "In the case of a right-angled broadening top, you can probably make money\non the triple top formation even before the broadening top breaks out. At least\nwith a broadening formation, you can anticipate when it will be time to close out\nyour position (do so when prices approach the lower, down-sloping, trend line).\nSame price. The three peaks in a triple top usually are sharp and pointed\nlooking, with rounded-appearing valleys in between. There are wide varia-\ntions in this pattern, so do not be too critical. Make sure the three well-sepa-\nrated peaks are not part of the same congestion pattern. Each top should be a\npart of its own minor high, a distinct peak that towers above the surrounding\nprice landscape. The price difference between the three peaks is usually minor,\nwith the center peak often below the other two. A large price variation should\nexclude the pattern from consideration.\nDownward volume trend. The overall volume trend is usually down-\nward and lackluster, but varies from formation to formation. Volume on the\nthree peaks, especially the first one, is higher than in the valleys.\nConfirmation point. The three-bump pattern confirms as a triple top\nwhen price closes below the lowest low in the pattern. Without confirmation,\nyou do not have a triple top and price is likely to continue rising. Alternatively,\nan up-sloping trend line drawn across the bottoms of the two valleys can also\nserve as confirmation. Often, this approach will allow you to enter a trade sooner.\nTo see what a triple top looks like, examine Figure 51.2. The three peaks\nare pointed, well separated, and distinct. The three minor highs are obvious\nand that is important in any formation. If other investors do not recognize a\nchart pattern for what it is, they will not try to take advantage of it. If they do\nnot buy or sell appropriately, the pattern will fail. Chart patterns are a self-\nfulfilling prophecy that depend on the crowd behaving the same way.\nAll three peaks are at about the same price level with the center peak a bit\nrecessed from the other two. This feature is common as quite a number (25%)\nof triple tops have a lower center peak.\nThe receding volume trend is clear in the figure with the first peak wit-\nnessing the highest volume of the three.\nAn interesting development in this formation is a trend line drawn below\nthe lows (not shown but it connects points A and B on the chart). With another\ntrend line drawn horizontally across the three tops, the formation takes on the\nappearance of a right-angled descending broadening top. In many triple tops, the\nbroadening formation also appears. This occurrence does not diminish the valid-\nity of the triple top; it just makes both formations easier to trade (because you can\nbuy or sell at the trend lines and take advantage of partial rises or declines).\nWeekly chart. The larger triple tops appear on the weekly scale, and Fig-\nure 51.3 shows an example. Even though the average triple top sports a 19% to\n24% decline, price occasionally falls much farther. As you can see in the chart,\nthe triple top marks the peak in the stock. From the high of 32.94, the stock\nplummets to 4.75, a stomach-churning decline of 86% in 2 years.\n782\nTriple Tops",

I classify a failure of a triple top\nto be when price reaches the confirmation point and continues moving down\nby less than 5% before turning around and heading meaningfully higher. This\nis a key point. Prices must decline to the confirmation point, the lowest low\nreached in the formation. If prices do not decline to that level, then the three-\nbump formation is not a triple top—it is just a collection of minor highs (or, per-\nhaps, some other formation).\nFigure 51.4 shows a typical example of a 5% failure. The three tops are dis-\ntinct minor highs that form after a 2-month spurt upward.

The lowest low is just a smidgen below the confirmation point,\nwhich validates the formation, before prices begin climbing again.\nHad you sold this stock short at the confirmation point of 20.25, you\nshould have covered your trade once prices climbed above the highest high in\nthe formation, in this case, 23.88. This tactic would have kept losses to a rather\nlarge 18%, but that is certainly better than hoping for a decline while watch-\ning it rise to 33!\nSometimes, it is difficult to determine exactly why a stock fails to perform\nas expected. Often fundamentals are the key. In this case, the oil-field services\nsector was improving due to an increase in exploration activity and deep water\ndrilling. In late January, the Federal Reserve cut two key interest rates by\n0.25% giving hope that the health of the overall economy would improve.\nOn the technical front, if you draw trend lines along the three tops and\nthe minor lows, the formation takes on the appearance of a descending broad-\nening wedge since the three tops are at consecutively lower prices. With the\nwedge, it is difficult to predict in which direction the breakout will occur. The\nfundamentals suggest the breakout will be upward, and that is exactly what\nhappens. The formation serves as a resting place for the stock as it gathers\nstrength for the next up leg.\nOne could view the formation as the corrective phase of a measured move\nup formation.

I uncovered 627 triple tops.\nReversal or continuation. Since we are dealing with tops, most of the\nchart patterns acted as reversals of the uptrend. However, I found almost 100\nthat formed as a congestion area in a falling price trend. Those I call continu-\nations because price continues lower after the breakout.\nThe performance difference between continuations and reversals is slight,\n25% versus 23% in a bear market. A bull market shows no performance dif-\nference. Still, if you see a triple top forming in a downtrend, that will be the\none to consider shorting.\nAverage decline. The average decline in a bear market is 24%, slightly\nahead of the 19% decline in a bull market.\nDeclines over 45%. Bearish chart patterns never perform well in this\ncategory and the results speak for themselves. Just 7% of the bear market pat-\nterns decline more than 45% after the breakout.\nChange after trend ends. Once price reaches the ultimate low, it soars\nbetween 46% and 53%. That gain may sound huge, and I often wish for such\nresults, but it pales in comparison to other patterns that show recoveries of\n60% or more.\nBusted pattern performance. If you find a triple top in which price\ndrops less than 5% before shooting upward, buy it. Chances are the rise is\ngoing to be an exceptional one. In a bull market, the rise averages 63%, but\nthat observation comes from just 18 samples. In all likelihood, the results will\nshrink like cotton socks in hot water as more samples become available.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change. If you compare the average decline\n(19%, 24%) with the market change from the breakout to the ultimate low\n(1%, –15%), you can see the market influence on triple top performance. A\nbear market helps stocks decline. This finding suggests that you short a stock\nin a bear market or sell a long holding before the cleaners find you.\nDays to ultimate low. In a bull market, it takes about 2 months to reach\nthe ultimate low and about 1.5 months in a bear market. Comparing the aver-\nage decline in both markets, the slope of the decline must be steeper in a bear\nmarket than in a bull one. This finding emphasizes the need for stops. Without\na stop, if you are not careful, your loss can grow to huge proportions quickly.\nTable 51.3 shows failure rates for triple tops. Clearly, the bear market\nnumbers are lower than the bull market ones. For example, 5% of the triple\ntops I looked at in a bear market failed to decline at least 5%. Almost half,\n46%, failed to drop at least 20%. In a bull market, the result is even worse with\n63% failing to drop at least 20%.\nThe table suggests you trade this pattern in a bear market. That is the\ntime to consider shorting a stock. If you own a stock, and a confirmed triple top\nappears, sell it. You can always buy back into the stock once it bounces off the\nbottom, 20% below where it is selling now.\n786\nTriple Tops",

    "text": "Yearly position, performance. In a bull market, the best performance\ncomes from triple tops with breakouts near the yearly high. In a bear market,\nthe worst performance comes from the same range.\nPullbacks. Pullbacks occur in almost two out of three patterns, and price\ntakes about 11 days to return to the breakout price. When a pullback occurs,\nperformance suffers. For example, in a bull market prices decline 18% after\nthe breakout when a pullback is present. Without a pullback, the decline mea-\nsures 21%.\nGaps. Gaps that occur on the breakout day tend to send prices down far-\nther than breakouts without gaps. Look at the gap size: $0.85 in a bull market\nand double that, $1.76, in a bear market. That is huge! The bad news is that\nyou must have a position in the stock before the gap in order to participate fully\nin the decline.\nTable 51.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate low.\nThe first week sees the most triple tops bottom out, about 25%. In a bear mar-\nket, half will reach the ultimate low by week 3. Thus, if you short a stock show-\ning a triple top, expect a quick but sharp decline. At the other end of the table,\nalmost a third (29%) of the triple tops in a bull market are still searching for the\nultimate low after 2.5 months.\nNotice the slight rise during week 7 (49 days) in a bull market. Eight per-\ncent of the patterns reach the ultimate low then, about double the surrounding\nweeks. If you see price showing signs of turning up 1.5 months into the trade,\nthen close out your short position.\nTable 51.6 shows size statistics.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform better than short ones, but the results are\ncloser than I expected.\nWidth. Narrow patterns beat wide ones, but, again, the numbers are\nclose. I use the median length to separate wide patterns from narrow ones.\nAverage formation length. The average triple top is 2 months long in a\nbear market and 3 months long in a bull market.

    "text": "of 12.12 (that is, 17.75–5.63). The figure shows price reaching the target in\nmid-June.\nTo better gauge the veracity of the result, you might look at the predicted\ndecline in percentage terms. From the confirmation point (the lowest low) of\n17.75, a 5.63 point decline is a loss of 32%. Table 51.3 indicates that less than\n18% of the formations have losses over 30%. Those are terrible odds.\nIn such a situation, and in most cases, you should look at support levels.\nPrices indicate support when they decline to a level and then rebound. For\nexample, the stock paused at $16 during July and August 1991 (not shown in\nFigure 51.5). This pause created the support level where the stock again paused\nduring April. Eventually, the stock worked through the support and tumbled to\na lower support level.\nWait for confirmation. In a roaring bull market, triple tops are often\ndeceiving. Three price bumps appear and price does not decline to the confir-\nmation point before soaring. Thus, an important guideline in using triple tops\nis to wait for prices to close below the confirmation point.\nTrade the trend line. Draw the trend line connecting the two valleys. If\nthis trend line slopes upward, a trade signals when price closes below it. This\nmethod will often get you in sooner than waiting for price to close below the\nlowest low.\nWait for pullback. Pullbacks occur over 60% of the time, so if you miss\nthe original breakout, you can often place your trade during the pullback. Fig-\nure 51.5 shows a quick pullback occurring just 2 days after the breakout (I\ndefine a breakout as being when price closes below the confirmation point).\nJust over a month later, investors have other opportunities (because price rises\nto the breakout point) to add to their position before the decline really begins.\nStop loss. Should the trade go against you, place a stop-loss order $0.10\nabove the nearest high. Since the three tops establish a resistance zone, prices\nwill not hit the stop order until the resistance burns through. Sometimes a\nfourth peak will appear before prices move down.\nSample Trade\nDanielle is in charge of the family finances. To boost the return on their sav-\nings, she has taken to playing the stock market. Her first few trades were ten-\ntative but profitable. That gave her enough courage to undertake the trade\nfeatured in Figure 51.5.\nShe is a brilliant, anxious, high-energy person who is comfortable taking\nmore risks than most people, so it came as no surprise when she jumped the\ngun and sold the stock short in early January. She wanted to maximize her\ngains and once prices were clearly heading down, she placed the trade and\nreceived a fill at 21.50.\n792\nTriple Tops",

    "text": "The day after she shorted, the stock turned around and headed back up,\nmaking a fourth peak. Instead of covering her loss, she decided to hang on. It\nwas a good call as prices flipped around and headed back down. Seven days\nlater they reached the confirmation point of 17.75 but stalled.\nTo Danielle, it looked as though the triple top became a multiple top and\nlater developed into an unconfirmed double bottom. Each day as prices\nclimbed and her gains dwindled, she became more nervous holding onto her\nshort position.\nEventually, fear overcame greed and she covered her position at 22.25,\nsuffering a minor loss of less than a point. A week or so after she bailed out, the\nstock was lower and it kept moving down. Eventually, the stock bottomed out\nat 9.38, comfortably below the predicted price and well below her entry point\nat 21.50.\nDanielle made two mistakes with this trade. First she did not wait for\nprice to close below the confirmation point. Had she waited, she would have\nseen the false double bottom (it never confirmed as a true double bottom\nbecause price did not close above the highest high between the two bottoms).\nFurthermore, she was not patient enough for the trade to work out.\nWhen a trade goes against you, most times it is wise to quickly close out a posi-\ntion, especially if it is a short sale where losses can be unlimited. However,\nthere are times, such as this trade, where a bit of patience is necessary along\nwith a properly placed stop. Since the three peaks represent a resistance zone,\nit is wise to place a stop just above the highest high and then wait for price to\nhit it. Had Danielle waited, the trade would have worked out better than her\nanalysis predicted.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select triple tops that per-\nform better after the breakout.

When\ncompared to other chart patterns, the failure rate is a bit high except for down-\nward breakouts in a bear market. The average rise or decline is also unexciting.\nCoupled with their rare appearance and the difficulty in spotting these patterns\nin the bush, falling wedges are beasts you probably will not want to trade. Still,\nthey can come in as handy as metric wrenches.\nConcerning surprises, the lineup shows the typical suspects. I found an\nunusually high number of wedges with a random volume shape. They tended\nto perform well when the breakout was upward. Busted patterns also per-\nformed well, but the sample size was small, leading me to question the results.\nFinally, I did a frequency distribution of the breakout distance to the wedge\napex and found that the best performers in a bull market had upward breakouts\n55% to 80% of the way to the apex, with rises averaging 37%. Remember that\neven though a falling wedge may have a breakout 60% of the way to the apex,\nthat does not mean you will see a 37% rise. Since we are dealing with probabil-\nities, anything can happen, but the statistics suggest a more powerful move.\nThe percentage meeting the price target (that is, the measure rule) for\nupward breakouts uses the highest high in the wedge for the target—an easy\nobjective. For downward breakouts, I use the formation height subtracted from\nthe breakout price. That method is why downward breakouts rarely hit their\ntargets but upward breakouts do better.\nTour\nFigure 52.1 shows a falling wedge. Prices tagged a new low in late July and\nbounced upward.

    "text": "Another up and down oscillation occurred during mid-August just before\nprices finally reached a new low.\nIf you draw a trend line along the bottom of the minor lows and another\nalong the tops, you see the familiar shape of a falling wedge. Falling wedges are\nrare formations that have price movements bounded by two down-sloping and\nconverging trend lines. When drawn on the chart, the picture looks like a\nwedge tilted downward.\nOnce prices break out upward, they rise and quickly climb above the top\nof the formation. Many times prices continue moving up.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 52.1 shows identification guidelines, of which there are few.\nTwo down-sloping trend lines. As mentioned before, two trend lines\noutline the price action. Both trend lines slope downward, with the top trend\nline having a steeper slope than the bottom one. Eventually, the two trend lines\nintersect at the wedge apex. You can see this in the wedge pictured in Figure\n52.2. This wedge forms as part of a consolidation pattern in an uptrend. Prices\noscillate from one trend line to the other several times before breaking out of\nthe narrowing price pattern in mid-June.\nMultiple touches. I usually regard five touches as the minimum neces-\nsary to safeguard a good formation. The reason for the multiple touches is that\nthe price pattern creates several minor highs and minor lows, each succeeding\none narrower than the last.

    "text": "Three-week minimum. Taken together, the wedge should have a min-\nimum duration of 3 weeks and seldom does it last over 4 or 5 months. The for-\nmations in this study, for example, have durations from 3 weeks to 1 year.\nDurations shorter than 3 weeks are probably pennants.\nVolume trend. The volume trend should be downward. This is not an\ninviolate rule; it is only a guideline that usually rings true. For this study, 7 out\nof every 10 formations show a downward volume pattern.\nOnce price pierces the upper trendline, it continues higher. Figure 52.2\nshows price staging a breakout in mid-June and reaching the ultimate high in\nearly October. The rise, at 17% from the breakout, is well below the average rise.\nWhy do falling wedges act as they do? About half of the formations act as\nconsolidations of the prevailing trend. Like the wedge shown in Figure 52.2,\nprices are heading upward when they run into turbulence. Investors pause from\ntheir buying spree and sit on the sidelines. Price retraces its rise by creating the\nwedge, oscillating in ever-narrowing spirals, until the buying enthusiasm\nresumes. Volume shows this lack of enthusiasm as it recedes. When buying\nmomentum resumes, price and volume shoot upward again after the breakout.\nThink of a falling wedge not as a pattern of weakness, but one of strength,\na spring winding tighter and tighter. As a spring tightens, it shrinks, and so do\nprice and volume in the falling wedge. During a breakout, the pent-up force\nreleases, and price bursts through the formation boundary and zooms upward.\nFocus on Failures\nLike many formations, falling wedges suffer from 5% failures (see Figure 52.3).\nThe falling wedge acts as a reversal of the upward trend. Although not shown\non the chart, price began rising in early December 1994. During creation of\nthe chart pattern, price moved lower in a narrowing channel. After the break-\nout, price climbed and reach a high of 45.38, less than 5% above the breakout\nprice of 43.25. From the high, price headed down and reached the ultimate low\nin late October at a price of 36.38. The inability of price to continue rising\nmore than 5% after the breakout constituted a 5% failure.\nThe causes of 5% failures can be many. Overhead resistance, as in this case,\nblocked the upward rise, so be sure to check for resistance before trading. For\ndownward breakouts, look for nearby underlying support that may halt a decline.\nOther causes may include a sharp drop in the stock market—that can\nkeep an industry down for months (think of airline stocks after the tragedy of\nSeptember 11, 2001). Certainly, a switch from a bull market to a bear market\nwill tend to keep high-flying stocks cruising at a lower altitude, but even a short\ndecline in the market can cause havoc.\nRising commodity prices affect the stock market, too. For example, nat-\nural gas and oil prices affect airlines, chemicals, utilities, oil companies, oil\nservice companies, refiners, and so on.

    "text": "Days to ultimate high or low. The rise in a bull market is slower than\nthe decline in a bear market. You can see this feature by comparing the bear\nmarket numbers. Upward breakouts take 77 days to rise 26%, but bear markets\ntake 32 days—less than half as long—to drop almost as far, 24%. Thus, bear\nmarkets are steeper and reach the ultimate low quicker than bull markets climb\nto the ultimate high.\nTable 52.3 shows failure rates for falling wedges. The best performance\ncomes from wedges in a bear market with downward breakouts. They have the\nlowest failure rates but only for small moves. Once price moves over 15%, then\nwedges in the bull market (both breakout directions) outperform.\nFor example, 50% of the wedges with downward breakouts in a bear mar-\nket will drop less than 20%, but 44% of the wedges with upward breakouts in\na bull market will fail to rise at least 20%. Thus, if you expect a large move,\ntrade wedges in a bull market with upward breakouts because they have lower\nfailure rates.\nHere is another way to use Table 52.3. Suppose you find a falling wedge\nthat peaks at 15 and spirals down to 10, where price breaks out upward in a bull\nmarket. Since the measure rule says to expect a climb back up to the top of the\nwedge, what are the chances of that happening? A move from 10 to 15 is 50%,\nand the table shows that 71% fail to climb that far. Thus, the measure rule is\nprobably wrong, and price is unlikely to reach the top of the pattern before\ntumbling at least 20%.\nTable 52.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\nFormation end to breakout. The time from the formation end to the\nbreakout for this pattern is simply a delay imposed by the program I use to\ndraw the patterns. Ignore the numbers.

Wedges with upward breakouts in a bear market do better with-\nout gaps. A contradiction? Many analysts will tell you that gaps improve per-\nformance, but I have found mixed results like those just cited.\nThe gap size, in the majority of chart patterns, is larger for downward\nbreakouts than upward ones. Why this is the case is unknown, but you should\nfactor that information into your short trade. While it is better to short a stock\nbefore the gap, can you still make money shorting after a gap occurs or does\nthe gap represent a large portion of the decline? My personal opinion is that\nshorting a stock does not yield large gains most of the time, and having a gap\nchew up some of it even before you trade suggests a more risky approach.\nApex distance. Where the breakout occurs is nearly the same across the\ntable: 56% to 59% of the way to the apex. As I mentioned earlier, the most\npowerful upward breakouts in a bull market (only) occur between 55% and\n80% of the way to the apex. Those falling within that range have rises that\naverage 37%. I did not measure the other variations of market conditions and\nbreakout directions because they rarely occur.\nTable 52.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Notice how quickly prices reach the ultimate high or low. In 2 weeks, over\nhalf the wedges with downward breakouts have bottomed. In 3 weeks, 65% of\nthose in a bear market have hit the ultimate low.

By\nthat, I mean wait for price to resume rising (after a throwback) or falling (pull-\nback). In some cases, price continues moving in the adverse direction.\nWatch for dip. As I was researching this formation, I noticed an inter-\nesting quirk. Sometimes prices drop below the bottom trend line, circle\naround, then head up. Figure 52.5 shows an example of this behavior. You can\nsee in the figure that in early January, prices break out downward, circle\naround, and then move higher.

But Clint has had some success because of the breadth of his offerings\nand some skilled marketing ploys.\nWhen Clint is not worrying about his business or pitching his wares to a\nprospective customer, he plays the stock market hoping to make enough extra\nincome to someday buy out his closest competitor. He added multimedia to his\ndemo and that is what alerted him to the company shown in Figure 52.5.\nClint watched the stock stumble and then saw the falling wedge form. He\nhoped that the new chart pattern marked the limit of the downward move and\nthat he could buy in at a good price with a mouthwatering chance of prices ris-\ning to the old high.\nWhen the stock punched through the bottom wedge trend line, he waited\nto see what price would do next. It curled around and made a mini head-and-\nshoulders bottom. He penciled in a neckline joining the rises between the two\nshoulders, following the slope of the lower wedge trend line.\nOnce price pushed above the neckline and above the wedge apex, he\nplaced an order with his broker and received a fill at 30. Clint’s timing was\nexcellent. Two days after he bought, prices were already in the mid-thirties and\nclimbing. He saw prices go horizontal in mid-February through March and\nwondered if this were the corrective phase of a measured move up formation.\nThat is the way he decided to play it.\nThe base of the measured move was at the head, 27.75, and the top of the\ncorrective phase was at 38.50. The height was the difference between the two\nor 10.75. Projecting the height upward from the corrective phase bottom of\n33.50 gave him a target of 44.25. He phoned his broker and placed a limit\norder to sell his holdings at that price.\nIn mid-April the stock left the corrective phase and started climbing again\non the second leg up. In late April, an e-mail message from his broker told him\nprice reached his target and the stock sold at 44.25. In the days that followed,\nhe smiled at his luck. Not only did he hit the high exactly, but the stock tum-\nbled below 30 by the start of July.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select falling wedges\nthat perform better after the breakout.

I pulled up the chart and, sure enough, the\nwedge was as plain as day and almost a year long. In my daily review of stock\ncharts, I missed finding this one. That is the major problem with wedges,\nwhether rising or falling. You cannot find them. Not only are they rare, but\nalso their spiraling price action seems hidden in a historical price series. A few\nstand out and shout “rising wedge,” like the ones shown in the figures accom-\npanying this chapter, but most remain hidden like a raindrop joining a pond.\nThe Results Snapshot gives you the bad news. Rising wedges are lousy\nperformers. In all market conditions and breakout directions, the average rise\nor decline is below the average for all other chart patterns. The failure rates,\nmost of which are double digits, are higher than I like to see and one even goes\nabove the 20% maximum I allow for well-performing patterns.\nAre there no redeeming qualities? Busted patterns perform well, beating\nthe average rise or decline posted by all rising wedges. So, if you see price nip-\nping outside of the wedge trend line that then returns and makes a breakout in\nthe opposite direction, it might be worth a closer look.\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about rising wedges is that the usual\nsurprises do not apply. For example, tall patterns perform better than short\nones, but that is only true for downward breakouts from wedges. Throwbacks\nand pullbacks usually hurt performance, but that is only true for wedge pull-\nbacks (downward breakouts).\nTour\nFigure 53.1 shows an example of a rising wedge.

    "text": "Three-week minimum. A rising wedge takes time to form. Prices make\nnew minor highs and minor lows as they bounce from trend line to trend line.\nIt takes over 3 weeks for the formation to take on the wedge appearance. For-\nmations shorter than 3 weeks are pennants. However, rising wedges do not last\nlong. Typically, the apex—where the two trend lines meet—marks the end of\nthe formation. Prices usually break out about half to two-thirds of the way to\nthe apex. Rising wedges rarely last more than three months (just 21 patterns, or\n3%, are longer than 3 months).\nVolume trend. The receding volume pattern is another key element in\ncorrectly identifying a rising wedge. Most of the time, volume trends down-\nward and becomes especially low just before the breakout. However, this is not\nan absolute rule. If you suspect a wedge but it has a rising volume trend, then\nignore the volume trend. Review the other guidelines (especially the number of\ntouches) to make sure the chart pattern resembles a rising wedge. If there is\ndoubt, do not invest until the stock breaks out of the formation. Not trading a\nwedge until after the breakout is almost always a wise course of action.\nRising wedges can form anywhere. You might expect them to form at the\nend of a long uptrend and that is indeed the case most of the time. Occasion-\nally, prices are heading downward and a rising wedge forms as a sort of retrace\nagainst the downward trend. After the breakout, prices resume falling.\nFocus on Failures\nWith poor measure rule performance and a small average rise or decline, it\nshould come as little surprise that rising wedges have higher failure rates than\nother formations. Consider Figure 53.3, a 5% failure in a rising wedge. Prices\nthat drop by less than 5% before moving higher I call 5% failures.\nYou can see in Figure 53.3 the chart pattern forms after a downward price\nmove of nearly 2 months’ duration. The wedge appears to be a retrace in a\ndownward price trend. The formation is part of the second up-leg in a mea-\nsured move up chart pattern. Not shown is the first up-leg but the decline\nbetween the two up-legs begins in late September, and a portion of it shows in\nthe figure.\nThus, one might have reason to suspect that this formation might not\nwork out as expected. Prices move up, touch the top trend line, and then\nbounce to the other side. Prices cross from side to side as they rise and form a\nnarrowing price channel.\nPrices drop out of the pattern 68% of the way to the apex, about where\nyou would expect them to.

The decline in a bear mar-\nket is steeper than is the rise in a bull market.\nTable 53.3 shows failure rates for rising wedges. Wedges in a bull market\nwith upward breakouts have the lowest failure rates.

However, the 8% failure rate in\na bull market is half that of a bear market (15%).\nLike all other chart patterns, the failure rates rise dramatically for small\nchanges in the maximum price rise or decline. For example, 8% of the wedges\nin a bull market with upward breakouts fail to rise at least 5%.

For example, in\na bear market, wedges with pullbacks declined 14%. Without pullbacks, the\ndecline measured 29%.\nGaps. Gaps on the day of the breakout helped performance as long as the\nbreakout was in the direction of the market trend (upward breakout in a bull\nmarket or downward breakout in a bear market). Countertrend wedges were\neither unchanged or showed better performance when no breakout day gap\nappeared.\nThe gap size was larger after downward breakouts than after upward\nones, and this finding follows a trend I have seen with other patterns. Thus, if\nyou want to take advantage of a possible gap, you must enter the trade before\nthe breakout. Entering then will increase your risk, as you cannot accurately\npredict the breakout direction. For reference, 44% of the time the breakout is\nin the same direction as the trend leading to the wedge. That finding means if\nprice is rising into the wedge, chances are it will breakout downward. If price\nis declining into the wedge, chances are it will breakout upward.\nApex distance. The breakout occurs between 56% and 64% of the way\nto the wedge apex (where the two trend lines touch), on average.

To improve the chances of investment success, sell\nshort after a downward breakout or buy long after an upward breakout. Price\nmust close outside the formation trend line before you place a trade.\nSell after throwback or pullback. If you miss the breakout, perhaps you\ncan jump in on the throwback or pullback. Sixty-three percent of the forma-\ntions pull back to the bottom trend line. Upward breakouts do even better,\nwith 66% to 73% throwing back. After prices throw back or pull back, wait for\nthem to start moving in the original breakout direction before investing.\nTake profit quickly. The last guideline in the table suggests taking prof-\nits quickly. The average decline ranges between 14% and 20%. So, in all like-\nlihood, the stock will decline only briefly before recovering. If the stock looks\nlike it is making a turn upward, then close out your short position.\nIf you are considering shorting the stock, check the fundamentals and\nmake sure there is a good reason for the stock to weaken. Just because you hope\nit will go down is no reason for the stock to comply.\nEven for short-term (long side) traders, I do not suggest they sell their\nholdings if they see a rising wedge in a stock they own. Of course, if the fun-\ndamentals suggest otherwise, then sell your holdings and look elsewhere for\nanother opportunity.\nFor upward breakouts, this rise is not all that exciting—17% to 28%.

One of the qualities in which\nhe is gifted is patience. He handles stress easily and does not let small problems\nbother him. In his spare time, he likes to trade stocks and has developed a keen\nsense to make short sales work for him.\nAfter returning from vacation, Joe discovered the situation shown in Fig-\nure 53.5. He missed the initial downward breakout but still wanted to short the\nstock.\nViewing the chart from a longer-term perspective, Joe believed that the\nformation was an upward retrace in a long-term downtrend (not shown in the\nfigure). At a minimum, he believed the stock would withdraw back to its base\nof about 30. He would consider closing out the trade at that point and not\nbefore unless price rose against him. So, he set a stop-loss order at the top of\nthe formation at 36.75, about 0.25 point above the formation high.\nIf the stock continued in his favor, then it would be completing a down-\nward measured move. Joe estimated that the measured move formation would\ntake the stock to 28 and perhaps lower.\n824\nWedges, Rising",

Yes, and Table 54.1\nlists them.\nPrice gap, plunge. Suppose a company announces a negative event, usu-\nally when the market is closed. The news surprises stockholders and they line up\nto sell. The overwhelming selling pressure forces the stock to gap lower on the\nopen. For this study, I used a minimum event decline of 15% but most ranged\nfrom 25% to 45% and one was as high as 78%. Imagine waking up to find a\n$10,000 investment worth just $2,200. The plunge usually takes 1 or 2 days, but\nthe downward trend before price begins to bounce can last longer, up to 8 days.\nBounce. Prices bounce up, recovering much of what they lost during the\nevent decline. The recovery typically ranges between 15% and 35% and takes\nbetween 5 and 25 days to reach the top of the bounce.\nDecline. After price peaks during the bounce, it drops, falling slowly,\nuntil reaching a trend low 15% to 45% below the bounce top. It makes this\njourney in 10 to 50 days, usually.\nTo put the numbers into perspective, consider Figure 54.2, a 47%, 1-day\ndecline.

In just\nunder a quarter of the cases, prices bounce high enough to close the event day\ngap. That means prices rise at least to the low the day before the event.\nIn 3 months’ time, over a third of the event day gaps were closed. In 6\nmonths, over half were closed. Viewed another way, half a year after the mas-\nsive event decline, prices had not fully recovered in almost half the stocks\nshowing a DCB.\nBounce. The bounce height, as measured from the trend low after the\nevent to the highest high in the bounce, averaged 28% in a bull market and\n35% in a bear market. This finding surprises me. I would expect the bounce in\na bull market to be higher than the one in a bear market, but Table 54.4 shows\nthat such is not the case.\nThe time to complete the bounce was nearly the same for both market\ntypes: about 3 weeks.

I found that large event losses result in bounces that take longer to peak.\nFor example, in a bull market, a large event loss takes an average of 25 days for\nprice to peak in the bounce phase. Small event losses take 20 days to peak.\nTable 54.5 shows the postbounce statistics. Postbounce is the decline\nmeasured from the highest high in the bounce to the postbounce low—the\nlowest low before the postbounce changes.\nPostbounce. Once prices peak in the bounce phase of a DCB, they\ndecline 30% in a bull market and float like stones by plummeting 40% in a bear\nmarket. The time to make such a large drop is quicker in a bear market: 42 days\nversus 49 days in a bull market.

This criterion measures the decline if\nyou decided to ride out a DCB. The event low is the lowest low before price\nbegins its rise to the bounce high. The postbounce low is the lowest low after\nthe bounce. The difference between the event low and postbounce low is how\nbad things get after the large event decline. In a bull market, the additional\ndecline measures 18% and in a bear market, it averages 27%. Over two-thirds\nof the stocks (67% to 75%) dropped below the event low.\nWhat does all this information mean?

Should you ride the bounce upward and then get out, or\njust hold on? Answer: Ride it up and sell at the bounce high. Once the bounce\ncompletes, expect an additional decline of 27% for a combined loss of 67%.\nEvent start to postbounce low. The decline using the close the day\nbefore the event to the postbounce low measures 38% in a bull market and\n48% in a bear market. This measure is the average decline suffered by investors\nholding onto the stock until they sell at the very bottom. It takes between 69\ndays and 79 days to inflict such pain.\nStatistics\n837\nTable 54.5\nPostbounce Statistics\nDescription\nBull Market\nBear Market\nPostbounce decline (bounce high to postbounce low)\n30%\n40%\nPostbounce duration (bounce high to postbounce low)\n49 days\n42 days\nEvent low to postbounce low\n18%\n27%\nNumber declining below event low\n306 or 67%\n167 or 75%\nDecline from close day before event to postbounce low\n38%\n48%\nDuration from day before event to postbounce low\n79 days\n69 days\nNumber with another 15% decline in 3 months\n118 or 26%\n105 or 47%\nNumber with another 15% decline in 6 months\n174 or 38%\n135 or 61%",

    "text": "Additional DCBs. I looked at the number of large declines (over 15%)\nin the days after a DCB. My contention is that a DCB follows a DCB because\nmanagement cannot fix severe problems in just one quarter.\nFor which data were available, 26% to 47% of the DCBs followed an\nexisting DCB in 3 months, and 38% to 61% had another DCB within 6\nmonths. Especially in a bear market, the numbers suggest that you make the\nbest of a bad situation and get out of a long holding during the bounce phase.\nIf you do not sell, you will suffer through the decline, and the chances of\nanother DCB occurring are high.\nTable 54.6 shows a frequency distribution of time for the three phases of\na DCB, in calendar days, not trading days. What do the numbers tell us? \nEvent decline. Consider the event decline, the first block of numbers.\nThis block shows how quickly price bottoms after a massive decline. For exam-\nple, in a bear market 53% of the stocks with DCBs reach the trend low in 2\ndays or less. Since the columns are additive, 71% (53% + 8% + 10%) reach\nbottom in 6 days or less.\nBounce. The next block shows the time for prices to rise to the top of the\nbounce after reaching the event low. For example, in a bear market, 30% of the\nstocks showing a DCB take 5 days or less to reach the highest high before price\nbegins another decline. In 10 days time, almost half—48% (30% + 18%)—will\nhave reached the bounce high.\n838\nDead-Cat Bounce\nTable 54.6\nFrequency Distribution of Time\nDays:\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n>18\nEvent decline, \nbear market\n53%\n8%\n10%\n7%\n4%\n3%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n9%\nEvent decline, \nbull market \n54%\n6%\n8%\n8%\n4%\n3%\n4%\n2%\n2%\n11%\nDays:\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n>45\nBounce rise, \nbear market\n30%\n18%\n8%\n10%\n9%\n5%\n2%\n3%\n3%\n11%\nBounce rise, \nbull market \n26%\n19%\n12%\n7%\n7%\n5%\n4%\n1%\n4%\n15%\nDays:\n10 \n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n>90\nPostbounce \ndecline, \nbear market\n19%\n20%\n17%\n6%\n13%\n5%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n9%\nPostbounce \ndecline, \nbull market \n16%\n20%\n14%\n11%\n8%\n5%\n6%\n4%\n3%\n15%",

Within a month, 56% (19% + 20% + 17%) will have bottomed.\nThe table gives you some idea of how long it will take the average stock\nto navigate the three phases of a DCB: the event decline, the bounce phase, and\nthe postbounce decline. Remember, though, that since we are dealing with\nprobabilities here, anything can happen.\nTable 54.7 is similar to Table 54.6 but concerns price.\nEvent decline. The first block of numbers shows the decline from the\nclose the day before the event to the event low. For example, in a bear market\n6% of the stocks with DCBs show declines of between 15% and 20%. Since\nthe columns are additive, 39% (0% + 6% + 16% + 17%) have declines that\nrange up to 30%. The table shows that most DCBs (73%) have declines that\nrange from 25% to 45% (bear market) and 80% will decline between 20% and\n40% in a bull market.\nBounce. The next block of numbers shows the height of the bounce as\nmeasured from the event low to the highest high in the bounce. In a bear mar-\nket, for example, 17% of the stocks with DCBs have bounces that rise 15%.\nMost of the bounces (60% of them) will fall between 15% and 35%.

The final block of numbers shows the depth of the post-\nbounce decline as measured from the highest high in the bounce to the post-\nbounce low. For example, in a bear market, 5% of the stocks showing DCBs will\ndecline up to 15%. Another 15% will decline between 15% and 20%.

They can help you construct a trading\nplan to take advantage of a DCB.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 54.8 shows trading tactics for the dead-cat bounce event pattern and\nTable 54.9 lists additional stocks with DCBs taken from my database on which\nyou can hone your trading skills.\nSell long holdings. As bad as the event decline is, things will only get\nworse after prices finish bouncing higher. Table 54.5 shows that prices decline\nbetween 18% (bull market) and 27% (bear market) below the event low. Do\nyou want to risk those additional losses?\nSince you cannot avoid the event decline, ride it out, and wait for the\nbounce. Use Tables 54.6 and 54.7 to estimate how long and how far prices are\nlikely to bounce. I have found that an up-sloping trend line drawn along the\nbottom of the minor lows as prices rise is effective in many cases. When price\ncloses below the trend line, sell. You will not catch the bounce high and prices\nmay resume rising without adding a postbounce decline, but selling is the best\nway to protect your wealth.\nIf you happen to be short the stock and a DCB occurs, expect a bounce\nfollowed by an additional decline. Table 54.5 shows that between 67% (bull\nmarket) and 75% (bear market) of the stocks showing a DCB will drop below\nthe event low. You may be looking at the exception, so if price rises to close the\nevent gap (between 22% and 23% will, from Table 54.4), consider closing out\nyour short position.\nWhether price will decline again (after the bounce) largely depends on\nthe actions the company takes.

If the industry is suffering and the market is dropping,\nthen consider riding out the bounce with the expectation that price will resume\ndeclining. Between a quarter (26%, bull market) and half (47%, bear market)\nwill have another DCB within 3 months. Usually, these are quarterly earn-\nings–related events such as a weak retail environment (missed same-store sales,\nor missed earnings estimates). If the company cannot fix the problem in 3\nmonths, then another DCB may follow.\nBuy long. Trading the bounce is a risky maneuver and should be\nattempted only by seasoned swing traders. First, compute the event loss size\nfrom the closing price the day before the event to the event low. Is the decline\nlarge or small? Compare it to the median event loss shown in Table 54.4 for\nthe associated bull or bear market. If you are trading a large event, expect a\nlarge bounce but one that takes longer than usual. If the event decline is small,\nexpect a smaller but quicker bounce.\nLook for DCBs in a historical price series and trade them on paper to\nsharpen your skills before committing real money. Table 54.9 lists stocks with\nDCBs on which you can practice. Print out the price chart and cover it with a\nsheet of paper. Slide the paper to the right, uncovering the event. When should\nyou buy and when should you sell?\nBuy when prices finish dropping during the event decline (as close to the\nevent low as you can get).

The stock\ndropped five points (25%) after the company said earnings would fall short of\nexpectations and the outlook for the remainder of the year was grim. The stock\nclosed higher on each of the next 4 days and then closed lower. Jill, after see-\ning the stock climb the hill, sold the stock short and received a fill at the clos-\ning price of 15. She then waited, watching the stock closely. It continued\nmoving down—as predicted.\nThe earnings announcement forced the stock down another 20% in 2\ndays. Expecting another dead-cat bounce, Jill held onto her position. The stock\nrose in an uneven fashion over the next week or so, and then rounded over and\nheaded lower.\nShe connected the tops from the preannouncement day onward in a\ndown-sloping trend line. When price eventually closed above the trend line,\nshe knew it was time to close out the position. The next day she bought the\nstock back and received a fill at 12, 0.25 below the daily close. She sat back and\ntotaled up her profits and realized she made almost $3 a share, or about 20%\nin just 1 month.\nAs good as the trade was, had she waited until November to close out the\nposition, she would have made an additional $1.50 a share (the stock reached a\nlow of 10.50). However, between the time of covering the short and the ulti-\nmate low, the stock climbed back to 17.25.

I did not break out the statis-\ntics in the usual tables because I used a computer to find matches in the stocks\nI track. With more than 30,000 samples in some cases, reviewing them all would\nbe too cumbersome. Thus, the format of this chapter differs from the others.\nTour\nWhat does an iDCB pattern look like? Figure 55.1 shows the first example,\ntaken from a trade I made. The inverted dead-cat bounce pattern begins with\na large, 1-day upward price move. In this example, the stock jumped 15% after\nthe earnings announcement, gapping upward on high volume. The following\nday, it made a higher high, low, and close, but over the coming days, price\ndropped, returning to the launch point and then sinking moderately below it.\nHere is my notebook entry for the trade: “2/6/04. I bought 400 shares,\n300 filled at 30.30, 100 filled at 30.39. This is an earnings flag trade. I waited\nfor a retrace before buying because of a weak general market. Price may retrace\nfarther, but I expect a renewed climb. Downside is 50% retrace to 27.50–28.\nThat is also the site of the August–November 2003 peaks. Expect a rise to 35.\nThis could stall at 34 according to the point and figure chart. At 35, this goes\nup against a long-term down trend line from the March and July peaks in\n\n2000. According to the 1-2-3 trend change rule, the stock is poised to move up.\nPrice pierced the down trend line, retested the low, and is now breaking out to\nnew highs.”",

A gap usually sup-\nports the stock—as it did in late February—but price tunneled through in March.\nThe 35-price target comes from the earnings flag projection. From the\nlow the day before the large up move, price bottomed at 25.24 and then peaked\nat 31.88 for a height of 6.64. From the flag low at point A, 28.75, the target\nwould be 35.39. I played it conservative and rounded it down to 35.\nA 50% retrace of the up move in the flagpole would put the stock at 28.56,\njust above the high end of the gap, and just below point A. I find that Fibonacci\nretracement numbers (such as 38%, 50%, and 62%) come in handy to help\ndetermine support and resistance zones. You can see that price approached the\n50% retrace mark as it made a low at point A and then moved higher.\nSometimes I check the point and figure (PF) chart to help determine\nwhere support and resistance zones are. The PF chart shows overhead resis-\ntance at 34, and on the price chart, a solid block appears at that price in March\nand April of 2002 (not shown in Figure 55.1).\nTour\n845\nA\nA\nGood Earnings\nBought\nSold\nInset\nCoherent (Precision Instrument, NASDAQ, COHR)\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n28\n29\n27\n30\n31\n32\n33\n03\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nFeb\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan 04\nFigure 55.1\nGood earnings propel the stock upward by 15%.

    "text": "The 1-2-3 trend change rule is beyond the scope of this book (see Trad-\ning Classic Chart Patterns, Wiley, 2002, for an explanation), but it says price has\nchanged trend from down to up when it breaks a down-sloping trend line,\nretests the low but fails, and rises above a prior minor high. Those three crite-\nria were satisfied when price gapped above a down-sloping trend line connect-\ning the September and October peaks, as shown.\nHere is my notebook entry for the sale: “2/12/04. The Dow was up 123\npoints yesterday, but this stock hardly moved. Today, it has broken out down-\nward from a pennant. Time to cut the loss. I’ll sell at the market open tomor-\nrow. This stock did not do as I expected, so it’s time to sell. 2/13/04. The stock\nsold at 29.255.”\nSince my trading success depends on the market helping push prices\nupward, when the stock fails to participate in a market rally, that is often a red\nflag. Coupled with the breakout from the pennant (see inset in Figure 55.1),\nthat signaled a sell. One key rule with trading chart or event patterns is that if\nprice does not do as you expect, then close out your position. I did just that and\ncut my loss to about $450, or 3.8%. If I held on, I could have ridden it down to\nthe May low for a 20% loss.\nStatistics\nFor this pattern, instead of showing large tables of numbers, I show graphs. Let\nme issue this warning up front. The following graphs show averages of thou-\nsands of samples. Your trade will probably not act like the profile. Still, all of\nthe graphs suggest selling on day 2, when price makes a higher high. Whether\nyou buy back in later depends on the situation and price action. Use common\nsense and your trading experience to execute correctly.\nThe first graph, Figure 55.2, shows the price profile of between 29,600\nand 37,100 event patterns in which the high, low, or closing price moved more\nthan 5%. I used about 250 stocks to collect the data from as early as January\n1988 to June 2004. Not all stocks had data covering that period.\nThe figure is a frequency distribution of the average price change over\ntime. The vertical axis shows the average climb as measured from low to low,\nhigh to high, or close to close between the day before the large move (called\nthe reference day) to succeeding days up to a month later. For example, on day\n1, the intraday low and closing prices were 7.8% higher than the day before,\nand the intraday high was 7.9% higher. The following day, all three price com-\nponents moved higher with the intraday high topping out at 8.7%, the low was\n8.5% higher, and the close was 7.9% higher than the reference day’s high, low,\nand close, respectively.\nWhat does the chart mean? If you own stock and it jumps over 5%, Fig-\nure 55.2 shows the average price behavior for the next month. After the initial\nmove, expect a higher high, higher low, and higher close the following day.\n846\nDead-Cat Bounce, Inverted",

Now that I am a more active trader (to prevent such drawdowns), I\nknow it is smart to take profit if price shoots up 5% or more.\nTable 55.1 shows trading tactics for the inverted dead-cat bounce. I base\nthe tactics on the graphs discussed in the Statistics section. Since the graphs\nrepresent average price changes, your results will vary. Before trading, ask\nyourself if you should sell a holding to preserve profits. Remember, capital\ngains taxes may be important, and if the general market is trending upward,\nyou may decide to hold on for the long term. However, if someone sells you a\nlegal dollar bill for 80 cents, consider taking it. Twenty percent rises are rare\nin stocks, so sell because price will likely go down in the coming days. You can\nalways buy back in once price bottoms.\nMeasure the rise. Say a stock you own jumps from a closing price of 10\nto 12, for a 20% rise. Consult Figure 55.5 to see the average profile for price\naction over the coming month. Whether your situation will pan out like that\nshown in the figure is anyone’s guess. Still, consider the profile as you make\nyour trading plan.\nRises: 5% to 20%. All four profiles (Figures 55.2 through 55.5) suggest\nselling the day after a large rise. You may want to put a sell order at the intra-\nday high price of the event day (day 1). For example, if price rises 10% and\npeaks at 20 but closes at 19, put a limit order to sell at 20 the next day and see\nif it hits. If price looks like it is peaking without reaching 20, change the limit\norder into a market order and get out.

Since the median hold time for my trading this year is 26 days (which\nis unusually short, but markets are volatile), following my typical hold time\nmeans I might sell just before the announcement. It also means that I might be\nbuying as price declines into the earnings announcement. In many stocks, price\nwill start dropping midway through the quarter—not always—but that is what\nI have noticed. Trading the stock a month before the earnings release I con-\nsidered an acceptable risk.\nI bought and the next day, the stock zoomed up 20%. I heard about it on\nthe financial news that evening and took a closer look at the chart. I knew that\na quick decline often follows a quick rise, so I decided to sell and protect my\nprofit. Here is the notebook entry for the sale: “Date: 4/27/04. Shares: 1000,\nfilled at 18.308. Sell reason: stock jumped three points yesterday on hype about\ncancer drugs. Mood: cautious. I expected the stock to give back almost all of its\ngains, but it was up this morning, coming down. A quick decline often follows\na quick rise.”\nI sold well above the daily low but below the closing price. Still, I am\nhappy with my 25% gain in three trading days. From that point, you can see\nwhat happened. In early June, the stock dropped 10% on good news about one\nof its cancer drugs in joint development with Amgen, putting the price well\nbelow the buy point.\nI ended up having 3,611.79 reasons why I am glad I sold.\n854\nDead-Cat Bounce, Inverted",

    "text": "announcements I looked at broke out upward! In a bull market, 43% of the\n1,316 announcements I looked at broke out downward. The results surprised\nme, but market direction may have little to do with breakout direction.\nIn this chapter, I explore earnings announcements with downward break-\nouts only. I assumed that these were the bad earnings surprises. I also filtered\nthe 2,234 announcements by those with intraday trading ranges that were\nwider than average.\nThe performance of what remained appears in the Results Snapshot. The\nevent pattern usually acts as a short-term bearish continuation, not a reversal\nof the prevailing price trend. In many cases, the price trend leading to the pat-\ntern was down and so was the breakout. The break-even failure rate is high,\n31% and 26%, for bull and bear markets, respectively. I consider anything\nabove 20% to be unacceptable, so this event pattern is well out of the ballpark;\ntrade it with care.\nThe decline is just a bit shy of other event patterns, averaging 13% and\n17% for bull and bear markets. Once price reaches the ultimate low, it soars by\n51% in a bull market and 37% in a bear market. If you can catch this turn, then\nyou can make a lot of money.\nOn the announcement day, volume is heavy (above the monthly average).\nPullbacks occur just over a third of the time (41% and 45% in bull and bear\nmarkets), which is somewhat less than the 50% return rate for other event pat-\nterns. Performance is also light with 69% and 68% of the stocks reaching their\npredicted price targets. Values above 80% I consider acceptable, but few pat-\nterns meet that benchmark.\nSurprises are many but the notable ones are not really surprises at all.\nThey confirm what many traders know. This pattern is bearish, so it works best\nin a bear market when the company’s stock price is tumbling. The best per-\nforming patterns are those that appear within a third of the yearly low. Prices\ndecline by 20%, on average. Finally, after examining over 2,000 patterns, I\nconfirmed that a company having a bad quarter is likely to suffer in the next\nquarter as well.\nTour\nFigure 56.1 shows a typical example of a well-behaved stock after an earnings\nannouncement. Many times, the announcement is not startlingly bad, so price\ndoes not gap downward or make a large move. Instead, price drifts lower with-\nout a rush, staging a downward breakout. That is what happened in this exam-\nple. Price kept sliding until reaching the ultimate low. Price resumed its\ndescent in late February, eventually reaching a new low of 15.31.\nFrom the breakout price of 43.75 to the ultimate low of 27.25, the\ndecline measured 38%. That figure is well above the usual 17% decline in a\nbear market.\n856\nEarnings Surprise, Bad",

One reason for the poor performance may be support below the\npattern. Consider Figure 56.3. Price breaks out downward the day following\nthe announcement. On that day, the trading range was wide and the close was\nnear the daily low. This scenario suggested a lower low the next day, but the\nstock closed up sharply and then continued trending higher on following days.\nThe support zone in late 2002 stopped the decline in late January and\nApril. Nearby support in early April suggested price might stop there, too.\nAnother clue to failure is a rising price trend. From the March low, price\nclimbed quite rapidly for a week and then began rounding over.

Thus, 74% of the earnings announcements (866 + 582 out of 1,963)\nfollow announcements having the same breakout direction. If one quarter is\nbad, there is a 74% probability that another bad quarter will follow.\nSell short signal. Performance from this pattern is poor, so I suggest you\nlook for other event patterns to short. If you have a compelling situation, then\nreview the “For Best Performance” section. The stock should be traded in a\nbear market and the price trend leading to the announcement should be down-\nward. When price closes below the intraday low posted on the announcement\nday, then that is the sell short signal. Watch the stock closely as half the pat-\nterns bottom in the first week. Lower your stop as the stock declines. Keep an\neye on the stock 4 to 5 weeks into the trade as price sometimes rebounds then.\n864\nEarnings Surprise, Bad\nTable 56.7\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nSell signal\nFor intermediate- or long-term holders, do nothing, as the\ndecline is likely to be small. For swing traders, consider selling\nimmediately to minimize the loss. If price gaps down and the\ngap is small, price may retrace the next few days and cover\nthe gap.\nSell short signal\nIn a bear market, wait for a close below the pattern’s low and\nthen short the stock. It may bottom in a week, so watch it\nclosely. Use stops to protect your profits. \nMeasure rule\nUsed to predict a price target. On the announcement day,\nsubtract the intraday low from the high, and subtract the\ndifference from the intraday low. The result is the target\nprice. Price hits the target 69% of the time in a bull market\nand 68% in a bear market.\nWait for confirmation\nTraders can react to an announcement by pushing price in\nany direction. Thus, wait for the confirmation—a close below\nthe intraday low before trading the event pattern.",

Because on four prior occasions, that is what\nhappened (beginning in February and ending in March). If I saw price begin to\nrebound near that zone, I would cover my short.\nInstead of stalling at the confirmation line, price confirmed the double\ntop by closing below the line. The measure rule for the Adam & Eve double\ntop suggested a decline to 40.38, which is the height of the double top sub-\ntracted from the price level of the confirmation line.\nThe mid-January price gap was another support zone. Since price\nplunged through the confirmation line, I would expect support at the January\nzone. For a week, that is what happened. Price returned to the confirmation\nline in a 1-day pullback and then struggled lower on declining volume.\nWhen do you cover the short? I would be worried that price was climb-\ning again after the small island on high volume in late May. The volume spike\nsuggests renewed interest in the stock. I would have covered there.\nAs you can see, price fell short of the double top measure rule prediction\n(40.38) by dropping to a low of only 43.13.

It also helps to buy in a\nbull market.\nEarnings announced. When the company announces earnings, price\nmay move up sharply that day or the next if the announcement came after mar-\nkets were closed (sometimes price gaps upward). You can find earnings\nannouncements in the newspapers, on the Internet, or on financial television\nprograms. Announcements usually occur quarterly, so add 3 months to the last\nrelease to estimate the date of the next release.\nLarge intraday range. To be included in the study, the announcement\nday’s trading range needed to be larger than the 1-month average. The larger\nthe day’s price range, the better the performance (higher average rise with a\nlower failure rate), on average.\nIf price shoots upward on the announcement day and continues rising for\nseveral days, price will probably pause and form an earnings flag.

Do tall patterns perform better than short ones? Yes. In both\nmarkets, tall patterns do much better than short ones.\nTo use this feature, compute the GES pattern’s height by subtracting the\nintraday low from the high posted on the announcement day. Divide the result\nby the breakout price (the intraday high). Then compare the result with the\nmedian in Table 57.6 for the appropriate market. If your value is above the\nmedian, then the pattern is tall, otherwise, it is short. For the best perfor-\nmance, select only tall patterns.\nAnnouncement day volume. Does a GES pattern with above average\nvolume perform better than do those with below average volume? Yes, but the\ndifferences are minimal. I compared volume on the announcement day with\nthe 1-month average for the stock. Volume is the announcement day’s volume,\nnot the breakout day’s volume.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 57.7 shows trading tactics for the GES pattern. I do not recommend\ntrading this pattern simply because a company announced good earnings. The\nperformance is just not good enough to justify the risk of a trade. Look back at\nTable 57.3, the one showing failure rates. Almost half of all GES patterns rise\n10% and then tumble by at least 20%. Those are not good odds.\nWait for announcement. Never try to guess the breakout direction and\nbuy ahead of an earnings announcement. Before I trade, I always check when\nthe next earnings announcement will be (typically, it is 3 months after the last\none). If it is within 3 weeks, I will skip the trade because my holding time is\nusually longer than 3 weeks, and I do not want to hold it during the announce-\nment. In the few times that I did, the earnings announcement may have been\ngood, but the stock invariably tumbled. Why? Because traders were expecting\nbetter.

On February\n1, 2002, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FDA approved Neulasta, a\nlonger-acting version of the company’s Neupogen drug. That day, the stock\ngapped upward.\nLarge price move. I ran tests on the data and found that large price moves\non the announcement day suggested larger profits ahead. Thus, I computed the\naverage trading range of the stock over the month before the announcement and\nthen compared it to the announcement day’s range plus the next day. If either of\nthose days were above the average, then I accepted the pattern. I included the\nnext day in case the announcement did not make it during the normal trading\nday. In addition, I included days in which the price gapped, either up or down.\nBreakout. The breakout can be in any direction. A breakout occurs when\nprice closes above the top or below the bottom of the trading range on the\nannouncement day. It might occur the next day or it may take 3 weeks, but it\nusually occurs quickly (4 days is the average for both up and down breakouts).\nIn Figure 58.2, the breakout occurred the day after the announcement when\nprice gapped upward.\nVolume. On the announcement day, expect volume to be above average.\nThat reaction does not always happen, but when it does for upward breakouts,\nit usually suggests a larger move.\nInverted J-shape criteria, price rise, and trend-line pierce. Here is a\npromising pattern to look for that is separate from the other identification\nguidelines. After an upward breakout, price climbs and then rounds over, form-\ning an inverted J-shape that takes between 3 and 6 weeks to top out. The turn\nmay not be graceful, but it often follows a trend line drawn along the low prices.\nThink of this behavior as a flag or pennant, perhaps one that slopes upward (a\nflag or pennant usually slopes opposite the prevailing price trend). A trend-line\npierce is a signal to sell a long holding or short a new position. In Figure 58.2,\nprice follows the trend line until piercing it, moving downward, in early April.\nFigure 58.3 shows another example of the inverted J pattern. On April 10,\n1996, a news report said that Coherent received FDA approval to market a laser\nthat removed skin marks such as tattoos and birthmarks. The stock climbed, peak-\ning in about 5 weeks before heading lower. A trend line drawn along the three\nminor lows in April–May set up a sell or sell short signal that occurred about 3\nweeks later. The stock tumbled, but not before briefly climbing above the sell\nshort price in mid-June. In September, the stock reached a low of about 15.\nFocus on Failures\nThe major failure from this pattern comes from traders believing they can make\nmoney trading it. Consider Figure 58.4. The inverted J price pattern appears\nafter news reports that the FDA approved a drug in July. Price reaches a minor\nhigh at point A before declining to D.

However, I do know one thing to be true: The\nwider the intraday trading range on the announcement (or the next day), the\nbetter the performance.\nWhat does this finding mean? I measured the average trading range for\nthe month leading to the pattern and compared it to the range on the\nannouncement day. In mathematical terms, this is an average of the daily\nhigh–low differences of the prior month compared to the high–low range on\nthe announcement day. If the announcement day high–low range (ADHLR)\nwas larger than the average, the pattern tended to outperform. If the ADHLR\nwas twice the average, the pattern did better still with a lower failure rate. When\nthe ADHLR was 3 times the average, it did better still. Thus, look for a wide\nhigh–low price range on the day of the announcement for best performance.\nAs I mentioned in the Identification Guidelines section, one pattern\nshows promise. Here are a few statistics regarding an informal study of FDA\ndrug approval patterns meeting the J-shaped identification guidelines.\nI accepted patterns showing a price peak between 21 days and 48 days (3\nto 6 weeks) after the breakout, and then measured the decline from the closing\nprice at the trend-line pierce to the ultimate low. The 20 patterns (in 15 stocks)\nI found fitting the J-shaped criteria listed in Table 58.1 declined an average of\n18%.

Again, use the figures in this chapter as guides.\nFlag. The flag itself begins when price moves away from the flagpole\n(the horizontal cluster at point 2 in Figure 59.2).

A pennant shape appears as the flag portion in Figure 59.3, for\nexample. The flag portion in Figure 59.2 shows a random shape.\nBreakout. A buy signal occurs when price closes above the formation\nhigh. That high is called the breakout price or confirmation price. You must\nwait for confirmation. In too many cases, price turns down and drops below the\nflag low, meaning a pattern failure and a loss if you own the stock. In some\ncases, like that shown in Figure 59.1, you can get a jump by buying when price\npierces a trend line. That strategy is fine providing a trend line fits the shape\nof the flag portion.\nConfirmation price. Look at Figure 59.3. For ease in gathering statis-\ntics, I used the highest high in the pattern as the confirmation price. When\nprice closes above that price, then the pattern becomes a valid earnings flag.\nThe figure shows the confirmation price as the horizontal line. However, if the\nflag slopes downward, as in this example and in Figure 59.1, consider buying\nnear point 2, when price begins its uphill climb away from the flag.

Due to database limitations, not\nall stocks had quarterly earnings releases. Still, I found 564 earnings flags and\nTable 59.2 lists their general statistics.\nNumber of formations. I found 384 earnings flags in a bull market and\n180 in a bear market. These numbers suggest that there are more earnings\nflags in a bear market than a bull market (because the bear market is shorter),\nbut earnings at the start of the bull market period (1995) were scarce.\nReversal or continuation. Does the earnings flag act as a reversal or\ncontinuation of the prevailing price trend? Table 59.2 suggests that the pattern\nacts as a continuation of the short-term trend 76% of the time. If the price\ntrend was rising going into the earnings flag, chances are it will keep rising\nafter the breakout; that is the way to trade it, anyway.\nIn a bull market, earnings flags that act as reversals perform substantially\nbetter than do those acting as continuations. In a bear market, the trend is the\nsame but the results are narrower.\nAverage rise. The average rise in a bull market was 34%, but only 22%\nin a bear market. Both bull and bear market numbers are well above the 24%\nand 15% average rise for all event patterns, respectively.\nRises over 45%. Just over a quarter of the patterns (29%) in a bull mar-\nket and 14% in a bear market rise more than 45%. Again, performance is quite\ngood.\nChange after trend ends.

The drop measures from the\nhighest high after the breakout to the lowest low—a perfect trade and one you\nare unlikely to make.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change. Computing the change in the index from\nthe date the earnings flag started to the ultimate high gives a 7% rise in a bull\nmarket and 1% gain in a bear market. This performance compares to a 34% and\n22% average rise, respectively, for the earnings flag over the same period.\nDays to ultimate high. If you trade this pattern perfectly, how long will\nit take to reach the point of maximum profit? Answer: in a bull market, 114\ndays, or about 4 months; in bear markets, just over 2 months (80 days). The rise\nin a bull market is slightly steeper than the rise in a bear market.\nTable 59.3 shows a list of failure rates, beginning with the 5% or break-\neven failure rate. That is the rate I use to cover brokerage commissions, slip-\npage, SEC fees, and so forth. The table shows how often earnings flags fail to\nrise a given amount. For example, a third (33%) of the bull patterns and almost\nhalf of the bear patterns failed to rise more than 15% after the breakout.\nWhat is alarming about the table, and seems to be the case for many chart\nand event patterns, is the rapid rise in failures for small changes in the maxi-\nmum price rise. For example, the failure rates double from 5% to 10% and\nthen leaps again. Since every trade is different, your results will vary. Play it\nsafe and always use stops.\nSuppose your trading costs amount to 5% and you want to make 10% on\nevery trade. That totals 15%, but you know you will not win every trade. It has\nbeen your experience that you win every two out of three trades. Therefore, if you\nboost the profit margin to 20% (25% with expenses), that will compensate for the\nlosers, leaving a 10% average profit on all three trades.

A throwback occurs over half the time. Expect\nnearby overhead resistance to repel the upward price move and for price to\nthrow back to the breakout price. Price may not make it all the way back down\nor it may throw back and continue lower. It is the latter situation you have to\nwatch for.

Upside is measured move up: 31.45 –\n28.54 = 2.91 measure. From 30.63, close at the low, the target is 33.54 or\n33.50, rounded off. The recent diamond top should support this pattern. The\nmeasure rule worked for the October earnings surprise, and I expect this one\nwill work as well. Competitor Michaels is doing well also. Downside is the\nmost recent low, about 28 and change. That would give a 12% loss, a bit high.\nTighten stop to closer to minor low when I get refreshed price data.”\nStepping through the entry, I computed the target price using the mea-\nsured move up method, which is also the earnings flag measure rule. Price\nreached the 33.50 target 3 days after I bought.\nThe October earnings flag begins at the base of the flagpole as shown on\nthe figure. Price moves horizontally after the 1-day-wide pole then shoots up.\nA throwback gives back all of the profit and more in mid-November.\nThe mention of Michaels Stores shows that I checked others in the indus-\ntry, just to see how they were performing. I saw support, formed by the large\ndiamond and horizontal price movement, centered near 28.\nHere are additional notebook entries: “2/9/04 mental stop 28. 2/12/04 I\nplaced a stop at 30.84, just below the minor low. 3/4/04 Stop raised to 32.13.\n3/5/04 Stop raised to 33.23 after market close.”\nThese entries show that I placed a stop and raised it as price climbed, begin-\nning with the support zone at 28.

The relative strength index was in over-\nbought territory but had moved into the neutral zone. The S&P 500 index\nstarted tumbling and that was like swimming against the current. The stock\nwas also moving down and price had pierced the up-sloping trend line. Since\neverything looked bleak, I sold and made $1,350 on the trade.\nYou can see what happened to the stock.

    "text": "John was excited. He called me and gushed over the phone that his favorite\nclothing retailer reported total sales up 30%. “Thirty percent! Can you believe\nthat?” I popped his balloon when I asked about same-store sales. “Three per-\ncent,” he said.\nSame-store sales (3S) are sales from stores open longer than a year, some-\ntimes two. For fast growing retailers, they are an important benchmark to\ngauge how well the chain is doing. If total sales grow by 25% each year but\nexisting stores are suffering because the retailer is placing new stores just a mile\naway, then an investor might want to avoid the stock. Eventually, the chain will\nrun out of places to build new stores . . . then what?\nI looked at the retailing stocks I follow and searched for reports of same-\nstore sales. I found hundreds of them, so I decided to limit the search to those\nwith an above average trading range on the day of the announcement or the\nnext day. After all, if a retailer announces bad 3S numbers and the stock goes\nnowhere, do investors care? The filtering improved results.\nI used only downward breakouts so the pattern is bearish, and it usually\noccurs in a price downtrend. Thus, it is a continuation pattern of very short-\nterm duration (about half reach the ultimate low in less than a week).\nThe break-even failure rate is over 25%, well above the normal single-\ndigit values for well-behaved patterns (of all types), and it exceeds the 20%\nlimit I consider acceptable. The average decline is meager, too (12% to 14%).\nAfter reaching the ultimate low, what happens to price? On average, it climbs\n54% in bull markets and 39% in bear markets. Wow! This finding suggests a\ntrading opportunity: Buy long after the stock bottoms. That sounds easy but is\ndifficult to do. The Sample Trade in this chapter explores such a trade.\nTour\nWhat does the typical pattern look like? Figure 60.1 shows an example of a\nshort sale opportunity we all would like to have. The stock was on a tear\nbeginning in the summer of 1996 (not shown) and an almost straight-line run\nsince October 1997. It made a broadening top pattern beginning in April, \none I hesitate to show because of the amount of white space (it would look\nbetter if the mid-May peak touched the top trend line). Nothing is perfect in\nthe chart pattern business, and it was not until prices peaked in June that the\ntopping pattern appeared drawn properly. There were no hints of a com-\ning decline.\nTraders pulled the rug from under the home furnishings retailer when \nit reported same-store sales below expectations. The stock gapped down \nand then tried to close the gap, but failed. Price reached bottom in early \nSeptember.\nTour\n909",

    "text": "Identification Guidelines\nHow do you identify a 3S pattern? By listening to the financial news. On a\nperiodic basis, usually monthly but sometimes quarterly, many retailers dis-\nclose their sales numbers. Watch what happens next. If the stock makes a big\nup move, that is the kind of 3S pattern discussed in Chapter 61. If nothing\nexciting happens that day or the next, then the market is ignoring the result or\nis not excited enough to move the stock. However, if price drops, sometimes\ngapping down, or if it drops the next day (if the market was closed during the\nannouncement), then that qualifies as a 3S pattern based on bad news.\nFigure 60.2 shows another example of the 3S pattern. From the quarterly\nsales report in March 2000 (not shown), the retailer was doing well peddling\ncamcorders, satellite systems, and televisions. The following quarter, ending in\nJune, the company said sales of digital products were still strong, but why was\nthe stock declining? Was this a case of the fundamentals chasing the technicals?\nIn September, the company reported that sales were sluggish but in line\nwith consensus estimates. The stock gapped down 14% on the news but within\nabout a week, it was trading at the same price, completing a pullback. Whew!\nA close call, some thought. Not if you owned the stock. Pullbacks and throw-\nbacks are the last chance to get out of or into a trade, respectively. The figure\nshows what happened. From the close at 47.33 the day before the announce-\nment, the stock dropped to 14, a decline of 70%.

In other words, price does not decline far after the breakout.\nThis finding suggests a quick trade.

Apparently, a few patterns pull the\naverage upward.\nYearly position. Where in the yearly price range does the breakout from\na 3S pattern appear most often? The answer depends on the market. In bull\nmarkets, the pattern appears near the yearly high and low most often, but in a\nbear market, patterns in the middle range appear more often.\nYearly position, performance. Mapping performance over the yearly\nprice range, we find that the best performing 3S patterns have breakouts in the\ncenter third of the range.\nOne explanation for this finding is that companies with stocks making\nnew highs are performing well. Then gray clouds gather and the stock begins\neasing down as if seeking shelter from the storm. Same-store sales come in\nbelow plan and the stock tumbles in earnest. More 3S patterns occur, driving\nthe stock into the middle range. As the stock nears the yearly low, things begin\nturning up and fewer 3S patterns appear. The stock recovers and starts the\ncycle again.\nPullbacks. How often does a pullback occur? Over half the time—53%\nand 60% for bull and bear markets, respectively.

For example, patterns in a bull market show-\ning a pullback decline 10%; those without a pullback decline 13%, on average.\nI think of these results in terms of momentum. Price drops and downward\nmomentum builds, but when a pullback occurs, the direction shifts upward,\nkilling the downward momentum. When the pullback completes, the down-\nward momentum resumes but with less enthusiasm. Thus, price tends not to\ndecline as far after a pullback.\nTable 60.5 shows a frequency distribution of the days to the ultimate low.\nMost of the bull market 3S patterns (50%) reach the low in less than a week.\nPrice in over half (57%, the sum of the 7- and 14-day columns) of the bear\nmarket patterns trend upward within 2 weeks. Thus, expect your 3S pattern to\nbottom quickly. This finding suggests that the 3S pattern is most useful for\nswing traders.\nNotice the bump in columns 42 and 49, bear market.

To what price may the stock decline after the downward\nbreakout? Answer: 6. Find the pattern height (10 – 8 or $2). Subtract the dif-\nference (2) from the intraday low (8) to get the price target. If the result ever\ngoes negative, then ignore it. Chances are your stock will not go bankrupt.\nIf the decline seems unusually large, check Table 60.3. In this example,\nthe $2 decline represents a 25% drop from 8. What are the chances that the\nstock will fall that far? According to Table 60.3, 86% of the stocks in a bull\nmarket and 81% in a bear market have 3S patterns that fail to drop at least\n25%. Thus, the table suggests the stock will not decline to 6.\nTrading Tactics\n917\nTable 60.7\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nUsed to predict a target price. Using the day of the\nannouncement, compute the height by subtracting the\nintraday low from the intraday high.

If a breakout occurs, consider selling immediately. It may be that\nyour stock decides to decline by 40%. Why chance it? Other 3S patterns may\nbe coming in the following quarters, too. Weak same-store sales are like dogs\ndigging through your trash. The day after you take the trash out, you find it\nstrewn over your lawn. The dogs keep coming back. One 3S pattern often fol-\nlows another.\nHere is a caution for those who want to short a stock showing a 3S pat-\ntern: The pattern is not a good performer (high failure rate and low profit\npotential), so you should have solid reasons for shorting the stock. Just because\nthe stock has a 3S pattern with a downward breakout is not enough. Is price\nfalling? Is the announcement day volume high to propel price downward? Is\nthe intraday trading range unusually large—well above the 1-month average?\nIs support nearby, suggesting a pullback? Check the fundamentals.\nBuy signal, cover the short. If you can tell when the stock has bot-\ntomed, then buy. If you sold the stock short, cover your short or use protective\nstops to take you out when price reverses. For most 3S patterns, price will\nreach the ultimate low quickly, usually in a week or two (see Table 60.5).\nSample Trade\nHow do you profit from the information in this chapter? Consider Figure 60.4.\nSally is an experienced trader, but she is a shy, nonaggressive one. She will\nnot short a stock because of the inherent risk involved. She saw the situation\ndeveloping in Ross Stores and followed it closely, hoping she could profit from\nany trends.\nIn mid-October, a financial magazine reported that two insiders sold\n70,000 shares in the company. For them, it was a good call as the stock tum-\nbled. Earnings came out in mid-November and the market was not impressed:\nThe stock continued down for a week and then recovered before sliding again\nin mid- December.\nIn early January, the newspaper said that same-store sales were flat. The\nstock tumbled almost 2 points on the news. It paused for 2 days and then closed\nlower on the third day, staging a downward breakout.\nEventually, the stock found footing in the new year at just above 11 (the\nultimate low). Price consolidated at that level and then gapped upward on a good\nearnings forecast and a report that same-store sales were up 7% in January.\nThe rise was short-lived as price retraced almost all of its gain during the\nnext 2 weeks. Price bottomed again and looked as if the stock was forming a\ndouble bottom. At that point, Sally started paying attention.\nWhen price confirmed the double bottom by closing above the highest\nhigh between the two valleys, she got a quote on the stock and gasped.

The bottom of the flag was\nat 15.53, giving a target price of 20.72 if everything worked as expected.\nThe day price climbed rapidly out of the flag, she caught the up move in\nmidstream and bought, receiving a fill at 16.40.

    "text": "If you follow the retailing industry, you know about same-store sales (3S) num-\nbers. Some analysts call them comparable or existing store sales. They are sales\nfrom stores open longer than a year (but sometimes 2 years). The difference\nbetween 3S and regular sales is store openings. If a retailer opens new stores\nwithout closing old ones, expect sales volume to rise, perhaps substantially.\nThus, year-to-year comparisons for fast growing retailers are difficult. Using\n3S, the comparison is easier. If same-store sales rise by 8% this quarter com-\npared to the same quarter last year, then that is better than if the retailer added\n25% more outlets and total sales climbed by 8%. The sales climb might be due\nentirely to the new store sales volume even as existing stores suffered. Thus,\nsame-store sales numbers are important to investors.\nThe Results Snapshot paints a picture of carnage. When a retailer\nannounces monthly or quarterly 3S, the stock price can move up, down, or go\nnowhere. This chapter excludes the latter two possibilities. In fact, I only\ninclude above average price moves on the day of the announcement or the next\nday, or those with a discernible price gap on the announcement day. Thus, this\nchapter looks at positive surprises. The reason for using only positive surprises is\nto find tradable patterns. If a 3S day looks like any other day, do we care to\ntrade the event?\nSince I only included patterns with upward breakouts, the 3S pattern usu-\nally acts as a short-term continuation of the prevailing bullish price trend. The\nbreak-even failure rate is very high, at 20% in a bull market and a massive 27%\nin a bear market, with 20% being the threshold for awful. By comparison,\nwell-behaved bullish chart patterns have break-even failure rates in the single\ndigits. The average rise is a weak 23% and 14% in bull and bear markets,\nrespectively, as measured from the breakout price.\nSay you buy a stock showing a 3S pattern. What happens? Price rises,\nsure, but only for a few weeks. Half the patterns reach the ultimate high in 2 to\n4 weeks. Then what happens? The drop is breathtaking—a 28% drop in a bull\nmarket and 31% in a bear market. Do you want to risk that size loss? If you are\nan experienced trader who loves risk, a 31% decline is mouthwatering. Short\nthe stock and I explain what to look for later.\nTour\nFigure 61.1 shows an example of a 3S pattern formed in response to better than\nexpected same-store sales numbers. In early December, Circuit City reported\nNovember same-store sales were down 2% from the prior year and down 4%\nfor the quarter. The stock gapped up on the news, suggesting that as bad as the\nnumbers were, traders expected worse. Bad news was good news.\nThe day before the announcement, the stock closed at 18.69. It formed a\nshark-32 pattern, which looks like a midget symmetrical triangle, and then\ncontinued rising. Eventually, price topped out at 31.40, for a gain of 68%. If\n922\nSame-Store Sales, Good",

    "text": "you exclude the gap and measure from the breakout price (the intraday high on\nthe announcement day), then the rise is still a robust 45%.\nThat is how the 3S pattern should work.\nIdentification Guidelines\nIdentifying 3S patterns is simple; you just read the newspaper or listen to the\nfinancial news on television. On the day of the announcement, look for a large\nprice swing (a wide trading range). Prices should move up, perhaps even gap\nupward. If they do not move much or if the trading range is unremarkable,\nthen keep looking. Figure 61.2 shows three examples of good patterns.\nIn the first two cases, the daily low is near the prior day’s high. In the\nAugust example, price gaps upward. We are looking for good news that surprises\nthe market, boosting the price. How you choose to define a large move is up to\nyou. I included days that gapped upward or had a large trading range that day or\nthe following day. Why the next day? Because the markets may be closed during\nthe announcement and any price move would occur the next day. If the stock did\nnot react to the announcement, I ignored it. Table 61.1 lists what to look for.\nAnnouncement. I learn of same-store sales announcements from the\nnewspaper. Occasionally they appear on television, especially for the larger\nretailers.

Mapping the performance over the\nyearly price range shows that 3S patterns with breakouts within a third of the\nyearly low rise 33% in bull markets and 26% in bear markets, on average.\nThose figures handily beat the 16% and 10% rises for the highest thirds of the\nyearly price range.\nThrowbacks. A throwback occurs between 59% and 70% of the time in\nbull and bear markets, respectively. Figure 61.5 shows an example of a throw-\nback after the July announcement. When a throwback occurs, it takes about 10\nor 11 days for price to return to the breakout price.\nThrowbacks hurt performance in a bull market. For example, those 3S\npatterns with a throwback showed rises averaging 19% in a bull market. Com-\npared to an average rise of 29% for those patterns without a throwback, that is\na huge difference. Thus, it pays to look for overhead resistance before placing\na trade. That resistance level can repel price and cause a throwback.\nTable 61.5 shows a frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high. I\nconsider this table an important one because it gives you an insight into how\nlong it will be before you may need to take profits. Since we are dealing with\nprobabilities here, anything can happen, especially with low sample counts.\nA substantial portion of the patterns reaches the ultimate high in the first\nweek after a breakout (36% and 44% in bull and bear markets, respectively). In\ntwo weeks, 57% of the bear market patterns and 44% of the bull market ones\nhave peaked.\nNotice that 6% of the patterns top out 42 days after the breakout in a bear\nmarket. I have seen this behavior in other patterns. Thus, if you have a good\ntrade going, watch for weakness about 6 weeks into the trade.

When to sell is a difficult topic to cover in just a few para-\ngraphs. Price should climb and then start rounding over in a week or two.\nWhen you sense the top has occurred and price is heading down, sell, or at\nleast tighten up a stop. If price continues dropping, the stop will take you out.\nIf you fail to sell, the decline after the ultimate high averages 28% in a bull\nmarket and 31% in a bear market, well above the 23% and 14% bull and bear\nrises posted by the 3S pattern. Thus, you give back all of your gains and more.\nIf you own the stock and the company announces good same-store sales,\nthen watch the stock carefully. If it breaks out downward, consult Chapter 60\nfor more information. If it breaks out upward with gusto, watch for price to\npeak in a week or two and then start heading back down. If the stock peaks, the\ndecline might be a massive one, so consider selling then. If you are in a raging\nbull market and you like the company, then hold the stock, especially if it is\nnear the yearly low (the best performing 3S patterns start there). Eventually\nthe stock is going to go down, just keep raising your stop until it takes you out.\nShort the stock. Shorting a stock is a risky play as it depends on correctly\npredicting the top in a stock. If you suspect price has reached its high and is\nnow heading down, consider selling short. Use a stop to protect yourself and\nhave good reasons based on both fundamental and technical analysis before\nyou place the trade. With this pattern, the top usually—but not always—comes\nquickly.\nSample Trade\nLook at Figure 61.5 for a sample trade. Ann Taylor announces same-store\nsales on a monthly basis. Thus, you have plenty of trading opportunities each\nyear. The patterns marked on the chart are all valid 3S chart patterns. They\nhave upward breakouts and they gap upward or show an above average trading\nrange on the announcement day or the day after.\nIn the April announcement, price climbs and rounds over in a week and\ntumbles, ending well below the close the day before the announcement. That\ncurling action is an example of a throwback. The May announcement shows an\nupward price gap, price rises for another day and then it retraces in a flag pat-\ntern. After the flag, price resumes its climb in a stair-step manner. The June 3S\npattern is similar to April, only wider. Price rounds over and finds support at\nthe announcement day gap. Most of the time (91%), price will stop before\nreaching the bottom of the gap.\nThe July pattern looks a lot like the April pattern, including the decline\nafterward. The August pattern behaves like the May pattern, with a rise-retrace\nclimb. The September climb is a wider version of April, and so is the Novem-\nber pattern.\n932\nSame-Store Sales, Good",

    "text": "On this chart, we have five patterns that behave similarly (April, June,\nJuly, September, and November) with the other two showing extended rises.\nThese patterns suggest that you avoid buying a stock expecting a long rise\nafter a 3S pattern. A better plan is to actively trade the 3S pattern by buying\nquickly, riding it upward for a few days, and then selling. Alternatively, wait for\nprice to top out and then short the stock.\nBefore you short a stock using the 3S pattern, use a sheet of paper to\ncover each figure in the chapter and slowly move it to the right. Decide where\nyou would short a stock after the 3S pattern. Then move the sheet to the right\nand see where you would cover the short. How did you do?\nPractice on stocks you follow to get comfortable with the idea. Hone\nyour skills and test your trading technique on paper before trying it in the mar-\nketplace with real money. The 3S pattern is a risky way to short a stock, but it\nis easy to do. The tough part is making money doing it.\nAs I mentioned before, if you own the stock (a long holding) and it\nannounces surprisingly good same-store sales, use a stop to protect yourself.\nRaise your stop until a declining price takes you out. All stocks tumble eventu-\nally, so a stop-loss order is a good way to lock in profits.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help you select patterns\nwith improved performance. Refer to the associated table for more informa-\ntion on each tip.\n• Use the identification guidelines to select a 3S pattern. Those with a\nwider daily trading range do better and show smaller failure rates—\nTable 61.1.\n• Trade with the trend. Most patterns act as continuations of the upward\nprice trend, but reversals outperform in a bull market—Table 61.2.\n• Busted patterns may make shorting a 3S pattern easier—Table 61.2.\n• Avoid this pattern in a bear market as 27% fail to rise more than 5%,\nand 54% do not make a 10% rise—Table 61.3.\n• Select 3S patterns that occur within a third of the yearly low—Table\n61.4.\n• Performance suffers after a throwback in a bull market, so check for\noverhead resistance before trading—Table 61.4.\n• Be prepared to take profits quickly. Almost half (44%) of the bear mar-\nket patterns reach the ultimate high in the first week—Table 61.5.\n• Tall patterns perform better than short ones—Table 61.6.\nFor Best Performance\n933",

As I scan through hundreds of downgrades, I find a mixture of good\ntiming with bad, downward breakouts with upward ones.\nFigure 62.3 shows an example of bad timing. Investors started getting\nnervous in December after the announcement that same-store sales were up\n4%. In early January, the stock gapped down on weak same-store sales. Two\ndays later, the board authorized the buyback of additional shares, up to 90 mil-\nlion from 50 million. That helped boost the stock, but only for a time. When\nthe company released earnings, they were worse than expected and two brokers\ndowngraded the stock. Look how close to the bottom the February down-\ngrade was. Wow! Just over a week later, a rumor circulated that May Depart-\nment Stores might make a bid for the company. The stock started recovering.\nFigure 62.4 shows another example of the downgrade confusion. In early\nDecember, two brokerage firms raised estimates after the company said strong\nholiday demand for computers would boost quarterly sales above forecast. A\nweek later, a different firm downgraded the stock. That was a good call, because\nthe stock dropped . . . until another firm repeated a buy recommendation and\nmade positive comments (early January). The price bubbled up. News of an\nearnings warning killed the rise (mid-January). That news did not stop a bro-\nkerage firm from issuing positive comments (mid-February).

Splitting the yearly price range into thirds, we find that the majority\noccur within a third of the yearly low, regardless of the breakout direction and\nthe market.\nThink about the result for a moment.

For\nexample, when a pullback occurs, price declines 11% in a bull market. With-\nout a pullback, the decline averages 17%. Many other chart and event patterns\nshow this same result for both bull and bear markets.\nTable 62.5 shows a frequency distribution of the days to the ultimate\nhigh or low. Yawn, right? Nothing is more boring than staring at a table full of\nnumbers. Would you like to know when to sell? The table will not tell you\nthat, but it does hint that half the patterns reach their ultimate high or low in\nthe first week or two. About two out of three will top or bottom in about three\nweeks. Bull markets with upward breakouts take longer to reach the ultimate\nhigh than the other combinations. This table reinforces the belief that you\nshould be prepared to take profits quickly.\nTable 62.6 shows size and volume statistics for patterns forming in reac-\ntion to stock downgrades.\nHeight. I found the median height for a given breakout direction as a\npercentage of the breakout price and then sorted the patterns into tall and\nshort. Tall patterns performed substantially better than short ones in all com-\nbinations. For example, in a bear market with an upward breakout, short pat-\nterns had gains averaging 9%. Tall patterns scored rises averaging more than\ndouble—19%. This finding confirms one of my selection criteria: a large price\nrange (taller than the 1-month average). Patterns 2 or 3 times the average\nheight perform better still (higher profit) and have a lower failure rate.\nAnnouncement day volume. I compared the announcement day volume\nwith the average daily volume over the prior month and then looked at per-\nformance for above and below average volume announcements. In bear mar-\nkets, patterns with above average volume performed better than those with\nbelow average volume. In bull markets, those with below average volume per-\nformed better.

First,\nfind the height on the downgrade day by subtracting the intraday low from the\nhigh. For upward breakouts, add the result to the intraday high; for downward\nbreakouts, subtract it from the intraday low. The result is the target price, the\nminimum expected price move. The Result Snapshot (“Percentage meeting\nprice target”) shows how often this method works.\nBuy signal. Do not buy a stock after a broker downgrade unless you have\na compelling reason to do so. In many cases, the downgrade may be near a\ntrend change (from down to up), meaning that the downgrade often comes\nnear the yearly low, just as price is about to recover. Wait for it to bottom and\nthen buy cautiously as more downside may become apparent.\nSell signal—down breakouts. If you own the stock, sell immediately, or\npray for a pullback and sell then. If you decide to hold onto the stock, remem-\nber the statistics. The average decline is between 14% and 19%. Do you really\nwant to hold onto a stock worth a buck today when it will be worth 81 cents in\na few weeks?\nIf you own a stock and a downgrade comes, why are you still holding it?\nChances are it has declined far from the peak price.

Too often, price drops for a week or two and then\nrecovers. If you still want to short, sell immediately and use\nstops to limit losses. The best performance comes from\ndowngrades within a third of the yearly low, so check for that.\nShort the stock—\nIf the breakout is upward, watch the stock as it climbs.

If price bored through that level, then the next support zone was the\ntwo valleys in April and May at around 17, for a 23% decline (the horizontal\nsupport line).\nAs you can see, price drilled through the first support zone at 20. The\ncompany released earnings and they were well below what was expected, but\nthe stock soared that day. The next day, several large brokerage firms stam-\npeded for the door in their hurry to cut estimates. The stock gave back all it\ngained from the prior day, and more.\nPrice did find support at the next zone, as shown (point B). Price climbed\nto C, the level of the prior support/resistance zone at 20, and then dropped.\nThe ABCD pattern is a measured move down formation. The move from\nC to D should mirror the decline from A to B. Thus, if you do the math, it\ngives a target as shown, just above point D. The stock declined to the target\nand dropped to D before double bottoming (point D and the December low).\nTo exit the trade, you can get out as the target neared. Waiting for price\nto actually meet the target is not wise because it often falls short. In this case,\neverything worked out. Refer to Chapter 32 on the measured move down for\nmore information.\nShorting a stock is not for the novice. It entails unlimited risk as Don dis-\ncovered in the first sample trade. However, if you discover a downgrade with\nan upward breakout that rounds over, keep this chapter in mind. Do your\nhomework on the fundamentals and make sure you have valid technical and\nfundaments reasons for shorting a stock. Use proper money management tech-\nniques to limit losses if you decide to trade it.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations that may help you select pat-\nterns to improve your trading performance.

Well, not\nalways.\nThe Results Snapshot begins to tell the story. After the upgrade, anything\ncan happen. For example, suppose you own a stock in XYZ Company and a\nbroker upgrades the stock. You hear about the announcement on the television\nor read about it in the newspaper the next day. Which way will price move?\nAbout two out of three times (65%), the stock will move higher, as expected,\nand break out upward, climbing an average of 24% in a bull market. Then\nprice tumbles 30%, giving back its gains and more.\nIf the stock has a downward breakout, expect price to continue moving\ndown an average of 12% in a bull market before the decline stops. Then price\nclimbs by 44%. Both breakout directions spell a trading opportunity, but not\nin the direction you expect. More about the new trading patterns later.\nSurprising findings include the usual culprits and new ones as well. A\nlarge number (35%) of stocks have downward breakouts after an upgrade. If\nthe breakout is downward, over half begin a sustained rise (over 20%) within a\nweek. For upward breakouts, the reverse is true: Nearly half decline substan-\ntially (over 20%) within 2 weeks. I discuss these surprises later in the chapter.\nTour\nFigure 63.1 shows what I expected to see after a brokerage firm upgraded Dell.\nOn the day of the announcement, price closed at the daily high.

A brokerage firm announced an\nupgrade to the stock just 6 days after it posted a new high. Then the stock tum-\nbled from a high of 39 at the peak to a low of 9.62 almost a year later. If the\nintent of the upgrade was for performance over the coming year, you can see\nhow awful the upgrade was. This is not an isolated incident as the figures in\nthis chapter attest.\nLet me hasten to add that I am not picking on brokerage firms, analysts,\nor the brokers themselves. The research from this chapter shows that the mar-\nket’s reaction to a broker’s optimistic upgrade is not what many expect. It may\nbe a case of Wall Street saying, “buy on the rumor, and sell on the news.” In\nsome cases, the upgrade is prescient as prices climb. However, in too many\nexamples, the climb is brief and prices tumble.\nFigure 63.4 is another example of bad timing. The stock started down in\nApril as if the investment community knew the refinery industry was having\ntrouble. Then the company announced quarterly results and the loss was larger\nthan expected. Multiple brokers downgraded the stock. The stock tumbled on\nvery high volume and proceeded to dead-cat bounce. Amidst the rubble, a\nlone broker, one of the largest in the United States, upgraded the stock.

More about trading tactics later in the chapter.\nThe table shows how quickly prices reach the floor or ceiling. For down-\nward breakouts in a bull market, 53% reach the ultimate low in a week and then\nclimb by at least 20%. Bear markets with downward breakouts are similar, with\n50% hitting bottom in the first week. In another week, 66% bottom out (50%\n+ 16%). Only bull markets with up breakouts take their time reaching the ulti-\nmate high. Over a third (35%) top out in the first week. A quarter of the pat-\nterns (29%) do not reach the high in less than 2 months (over 70 days).\nTable 63.6 shows size and volume statistics.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform substantially better than short ones.\nUpward breakouts in bear markets, for example, do twice as well as short pat-\nterns—with rises of 22% versus 11%, respectively.\nTo use this finding, compute the formation height by subtracting the\nintraday low from the high using prices from the day of the stock upgrade.\nDivide the result by the breakout price, which for upward breakouts is the\nintraday high; for downward breakouts, use the intraday low. Compare the\nresult by the median listed in the table to determine whether your pattern is\nshort or tall. For best average results, select tall patterns and ignore short ones.\nAnnouncement day volume. I compared the announcement day volume\nwith the average of the prior month and then mapped performance according\nto whether the announcement day volume was above or below average.\nAnnouncements accompanying high volume performed better than did those\nwith low volume, except bull markets with upward breakouts. They climbed\n30% on light announcement day volume and 23% when volume was above\naverage. In all cases, the sample size was small, so the results may change.\n960\nStock Upgrades\nTable 63.6\nSize and Volume Statistics\nBull\nBear\nBull\nBear\nMarket,\nMarket,\nMarket,\nMarket,\nUp\nUp\nDown\nDown\nDescription\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nTall pattern performance\n29%\n22%\n–15%\n–22%\nShort pattern performance\n20%\n11%\n–11%\n–14%\nMedian height as a percentage \n5.61%\n6.10%\n5.32%\n5.25%\nof breakout price\nHeavy announcement day \nvolume, performance\n23%\n16%\n–12%\n–18%\nLight announcement day \nvolume, performance\n30%a\n11%a\n–12%a\n–13%a\nNote: Minus sign means decline.\naFewer than 30 samples.",

    "text": "Trading Tactics\nTable 63.7 lists a brief explanation of trading tactics. I do not discuss them\nindividually as they are self-explanatory. In addition, the following sample\ntrades use most of them.\nSample Trade—Downward Breakout\nFigure 63.5 illustrates a sample trade when a stock breaks out downward after\nan upgrade. In mid-February, the stock received an upgrade from a broker and\nit gapped higher. The next day, prices dropped, closing below the low of the\nprior day and signaling a downward breakout.\nBill’s hobby is trading stocks when it is too inclement to play golf, and he\nis an experienced trader. He liked Big Lots and watched the stock for months.\nWhen a broker announced the upgrade in February, that boosted his confi-\ndence in the stock.\nSince the breakout was downward, he held off buying, suspecting that the\ngap would support the stock. He was right as prices paused there. However, he\nknew that sometimes they continued down, so he waited to place his buy order.\nHe applied the measure rule to the upgrade. On that day, the stock\nreached an intraday high of 15.68 and a low of 15.12, giving a height of 56\nSample Trade—Downward Breakout\n961\nTable 63.7\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nUsed to predict a target price. Using the day of the upgrade,\ncompute the height by subtracting the intraday low from the\nintraday high. For upward breakouts, add the result to the\nintraday high; for downward breakouts subtract it from the\nintraday low. The result is the target price. Price meets the\ntarget between 67% and 81% of the time (see Results\nSnapshot, “Percentage meeting price target”).\nBuy signal\nAfter a downward breakout, prices drop and then start\nrecovering. Buy when you are sure prices are rising. Use\nstops in case you are wrong and to lock in profits.\nSell signal\nAfter an upward breakout, prices rise, curl over, and then\nhead down. Sell short near the peak and use stops to protect\nyour gains.\nIf you own the stock\nIf you own the stock, watch the breakout direction. If it\nbreaks out downward, sell immediately or buy more after the\nstock bottoms. If the breakout is upward, hold onto your\nstock until it peaks and then consider selling.\nWait for confirmation\nWait for price to close above the daily high or below the\ndaily low before trading.",

It took\nanother 3 days before price closed above the high on the day of the upgrade. The\nstock rose, following an up trend line drawn along the price bottoms.\nFor kicks, Bill pulled out a ruler, held it up to the monitor, and measured\nthe height of the day when the upgrade occurred. It measured three-eighths of\nan inch. He slid the ruler to the right and saw that prices met the measure rule\n6 days after the upgrade (a day before prices peaked).\nWhen prices gapped through the trend line on news that same-store sales\ndeclined, Bill considered shorting the stock. He does not like shorting stocks, but\nthe fundamentals seemed to be on his side. Still, he worried about the support\nlevel at 21 to 22 and expected prices to stall there. He did not short the stock.\nTwo days later, prices pierced the lower boundary of the support zone.\nStill he waited. Another week saw prices dip below the zone, then pull back\ninto the zone, and then begin heading down again.

Also known as the breakout point, price, or level.\nConsolidation\nSynonym for “continuation” when talking about trends (as in\ntrend reversal or continuation). A consolidation region is a solid block of\nprices or a region in which prices switch from trending to moving side-\nways.\nContinuation\nSynonym for consolidation. For a continuation, prices must\nbreak out in the same direction as they entered the pattern. For example,\nif price enters the pattern from the bottom and exits out the top, the pat-\ntern acts as a continuation. Sometimes an adjustment is made to the trend\nstart (affecting the direction of entry) for prices that overshoot or under-\nshoot the start of the pattern.\nCorrective phase\nPart of a measured move up or down, a region where\nprices retrace a portion of the prior move.\nCountertrend pattern\nA pattern with an upward breakout in a bear market\nor a downward breakout in a bull market; that is, the breakout direction\nis against the prevailing market trend.\nDays to ultimate high or low\nThe average time from the breakout date to\nthe date of the ultimate high or low.\nDual bumps\nIn a bump-and-run reversal, prices bump up (or down) and\nthen return to the trend line two or more times.\nEnd (as in “pattern end”)\nUsually the highest high or lowest low in a chart\npattern. For example, the start and end of a double bottom is the lowest\nlow in each valley.\nFailure rate\nA measure of how many patterns fail to rise or decline a selected\namount (like 5%, 10% and so on). The failure rate includes all chart pat-\nterns of the selected type breaking out in the selected direction. Patterns\nbreaking out in an unexpected direction are no longer considered failures.\nFlat base\nA consolidation region in which prices touch or come near the\nsame price level multiple times over several weeks or months, for which\nidentification is usually easiest on the weekly scale. The bottom or top of\nthis region may appear flat and sometimes forms the base of an impend-\ning up move, hence the name, “flat base.”\nFormation end to breakout\nThe delay from the end of the pattern to the\nbreakout.\nFrequency distribution\nA method to assign data to one of several nonover-\nlapping intervals. A frequency distribution shows how often values occur.\nGap\nFor upward price trends, a gap is when today’s low price is above yes-\nterday’s high. For downward price trends, a gap occurs when today’s high\nprice is below yesterday’s low.\nGap performance\nComputed using the closing price the day before the gap\nto the ultimate high or low for those patterns that use a trend-line break-\nout. For patterns that use the highest high or lowest low as the breakout\nprice, the high or low substitutes for the prior close in the computation.",

The handle measures from the right cup lip to the breakout.\nHandle retrace\nFor inverted cup with handles, this is the rise from the right\ncup low to the handle high as a percentage of the cup height from the\nright cup to the highest high in the pattern.\nHeavy left/right volume performance\nA comparison of volume surround-\ning peaks or valleys using, 2 days before to 2 days after the peak or valley.\nInternal partial decline\nAn internal partial decline is the same as a partial\ndecline (see that entry) only the breakout fails to occur and the chart pat-\ntern continues developing. Look for two consecutive trend-line touches\nthat occur on the same side with a minor low between them (it looks like\na loop hanging off the trend line). The minor low should not come close\nto or touch the opposite trend line. An internal partial decline only occurs\nafter the chart pattern is valid, meaning at least two touches of each trend\nline. See Figure 1.\nInternal partial rise\nAn internal partial rise occurs within a chart pattern\nafter prices touch a lower trend line, rise, and then return to the lower\ntrend line without coming close to or touching the opposite trend line. A\nbreak out does not follow. Look for two consecutive trend-line touches to\noccur on the same side with a minor high between them (looking like a\nhill on the trend line). An internal partial rise is the same as a partial rise\n(see that entry) only a breakout does not follow and the chart pattern con-\ntinues developing. An internal partial rise only occurs after the chart pat-\ntern is valid, meaning at least two touches of each trend line. See Figure 1.\nLead-in height\nThe height from the trend line to the highest high (or low-\nest low) in the first quarter of a bump-and-run reversal.\nLinear regression\nA method that fits a straight line to a series of numbers;\nthe slope of the resulting line gives the trend. Used to find whether vol-\nume is trending upward or downward over the course of the chart pat-\ntern, from start to end, not to the breakout.\nMaximum price rise or decline\nUsed as the nonoverlapping intervals for a\nfrequency distribution of failure rates, this is an arbitrary list of bench-\nmark values (such as 5%, 10%, 15%, and so on).\nMeasure rule\nVaries from pattern to pattern but is usually the pattern height\nadded to (upward breakouts) or subtracted from (downward breakouts)\nthe breakout price. The result is the predicted price target. See “Percent\nmeeting price target” in the Results Snapshot of each chapter for how\noften prices hit their predicted targets.\nMedian\nThe median value is the middle one in a sorted list of values such\nthat half the values are below the median and half above. If no middle\nvalue exists, the average of the two closest values is used. For example, in\nthe list 10, 15, 30, 41, and 52, the median is 30 because there are two val-\nues on either side of it.\n988\nGlossary and Methodology",

    "text": "Partial rise\nAfter prices touch a lower trend line, prices rise but do not touch\n(or come that close to) the upper trend line before forming a distinct\nminor high and usually staging an immediate downward breakout. The\npartial rise must begin before the breakout and form near the end of a\nvalid chart pattern (in other words, after the minimum number of trend-\nline touches, usually two). See Figure 1.\nPartial rise failure\nWhen a partial rise occurs but the breakout is in the\nwrong direction. See Figure 1.\nPercentage meeting price target\nHow often prices meet or exceed the\nprice target found using the measure rule.\nPerformance rank\nA sum of the individual ranking of the average rise/\ndecline, break-even failure rate, and change after trend ends, sorted, and\nranked. A rank of 1 is the best performing. Ties are allowed with no break\nin the sequence (as in 1, 2, 2, 3, not 1, 2, 2, 4).\nPosition trader\nA trader who holds a position for days, weeks, or longer fol-\nlowing a longer term trend. Contrast with swing trader.\nPremature breakout\nWhen prices close outside the formation trend-line\nboundary but quickly return. A premature breakout cannot be distin-\nguished from a valid breakout when it occurs. The second edition of this\nbook assumes the premature breakout is the actual breakout when com-\nputing statistics. The first edition ignored premature breakouts.\nPullback\nA temporary retrace after a downward breakout. Prices return to,\nor come very close to, the breakout price or trend line within 30 days \nafter the breakout. White space must appear between the hooking price\naction of the pullback and the breakout price. This rule prevents the \npullback term being applied to prices clustering near the breakout price.\nSee Figure 1.\nQualifying\nA pattern must meet the breakout direction (up or down) and\nmarket type (bull or bear) to be used in calculations.\nR/C performance\nThe performance of reversals or continuations, measured\nseparately.\nReversal\nThe movement of price when it enters and exits the chart pattern\nfrom the same side. Overshoot and undershoot are ignored in determin-\ning the entry direction.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change\nThe change in the S&P 500 index from the\ndate of the chart pattern breakout to the date of the ultimate high or low.\nStart (as in “pattern start”)\nUsually the highest high in a minor high or\nlowest low in a minor low. For example, the start and end of a double bot-\ntom is the lowest low in each valley.\nSwing trader\nA trader who tries to profit by trading the move from peak to\nvalley, or valley to peak. Usually holds positions for days, not months.\nTall or short patterns\nFormation height measured by taking the difference\nbetween the highest high and the lowest low in the chart pattern and\nthen dividing the difference by the breakout price to get a percentage of\n990\nGlossary and Methodology",

The median value separates the difference between short\n(values below the median) and tall (values above the median).\nTerm—short, intermediate, or long\nA short-term trend is one that lasts up\nto 3 months. Intermediate-term trends last between 3 and 6 months.\nLong-term trends are those lasting over 6 months.\nThrowback\nA temporary retrace after an upward breakout. Prices decline to,\nor come very close to, the breakout price or the formation trend line within\n30 days after the breakout. White space must appear between the hooking\nprice action of the throwback and the breakout price. See Figure 1.\nTrend high\nUsed for flags and pennants, the minor high that begins or ends\na price trend.\nTrend low\nUsed for flags and pennants, the minor low that begins or ends a\nprice trend.\nTrend start\nDefined as where a price trend begins. To find the trend start,\nbegin at the formation start and move backward in time. If prices climb\nleading away from the formation, find the highest high before prices close\n20% or more below and before the highest high. When this occurs, the\nhighest high marks the trend start.\nIf prices drop leading away from the chart pattern (working back-\nward in time), find the lowest low before prices close 20% or more above\nand before the lowest low. When that occurs, the lowest low marks the\ntrend start. Price overshoots and undershoots just before the chart pattern\nare ignored.\nFor flags and pennants, the minor high or low closest to the start of\nthe trend leading to the flag or pennant is used (not a 20% trend change).\nUltimate high\nThe highest high before prices decline by 20% or more,\nmeasured from the highest high to the close or a close below the formation\nlow. If the stock had not suffered a 20% decline before the end of the data\n(because it was too recent), then the highest high to that point was used.\nUltimate low\nThe lowest low before a minimum 20% price rise, measured\nfrom the lowest low to the close, or a close above the formation high. If the\nstock had not suffered a 20% rise before the end of data, then the lowest\nlow to that point was used.\nUndershoot\nWhen price suddenly drops a few days before the beginning of\nthe pattern. Sometimes called “overshoot.”\nVolume shape\nThe pattern volume makes. Consists of several shapes: domed,\nU, flat, rising, falling, and random. The last four I call random and lump\ntogether because they occur infrequently. For short patterns, if no volume\nshape appears, look to the left and right of the pattern to see if volume is\npart of a larger shape. If so, use that shape in your analysis. For large chart\npatterns, if multiple shapes are present, use the most recent. See Figure 1.\nVolume trend\nA rising volume trend means volume generally increases over\ntime; a falling volume trend is one that recedes over time. The slope of a\nline found using linear regression on volume data determines the trend.",

    "text": "About the Author\nBarbara Rockefeller is a writer specializing in international economics and \nfi\n nance, with a focus on foreign exchange. She also trades in the foreign \nexchange market. She is the publisher of a daily newsletter on the foreign \nexchange market, “The Strategic Currency Briefi\n ng.” Her newsletter combines \ntechnical and fundamental observations. Additionally, she publishes separate \ndaily “Trader’s Advice” reports for spot and futures foreign exchange trad-\ners. Newsletter subscribers include central banks, investment banks, hedge \nfunds, multinational corporations, investment managers and individuals. \nMiss Rockefeller also prepares custom charts on a consulting basis for indi-\nviduals and institutions. \nBefore starting the newsletter business, Barbara was in the credit, foreign \nexchange, and risk-management departments at several U.S. banks, including \nCitibank and Brown Brothers Harriman. Conventional economic theory failed \nto generate valid currency forecasts at Brown Brothers, which led her to \nspearhead  a technical analysis system at Citibank. This decision was in 1980, \nlong before technical analysis went mainstream and at a time when it was \nconsidered at least a little crackpot.\nBarbara has a B.A. in Economics from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, and \na M.A. in International Affairs from Columbia University. While at Citibank, \nshe traveled the world, training staff and clients on the fundamentals of for-\neign exchange, international economics, and risk management. Favorite coun-\ntry? Turkey. Smartest traders? Hong Kong.\nBarbara is the author of How to Invest Internationally, published in Japanese \nin 1999 (Franklin Covey), CNBC 24/7, Trading Around the Clock, Around the \nWorld, published in 2000 (John Wiley & Sons), and The Global Trader, pub-\nlished in 2001 (John Wiley & Sons). She also writes a monthly column for \nCurrency Trader Magazine.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Dedication\nThis book is dedicated to Robert James Deadman, founder of Technical \nSystems Analysis Group, who taught as much of “the scientifi\n c way of thinking” \nas it’s possible to cram into a “social science” mind, and with endless patience. \nI also dedicate the book to Alfred A. “Chip” Olbrycht, who forces me to question \nthe easy way and to look at everything a second time, and a third time, too.\nAuthor’s Acknowledgments\nFor Dummies editors Mike Baker and Alissa Schwipps, who caused much \nsuffering. I’m wrung-out, but you, dear reader, have a better book.\nAnd the usual suspects: Jim Sullivan, head of the Fairfi\n eld County Technical \nTraders’ Club, contributed numerous gentle nudges on perspective as well \nas how traders really use indicators and think about trading risk. Ed Dobson, \nfounder of Traders Press, and Perry Kaufman, author of Trading Systems and \nMethods, always generous. Most generous of all over the years is Desmond \nMacRae, whose ideas I gladly and routinely steal. \nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n[Formulas: 24/7]",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nl iming is everything.\n\nTiming is critical in cooking, romance, music, politics, farming, and a hundred\nother aspects of life on this planet. Putting money into a securities market is\nno different — you need good timing to get the best results.\n\nTechnical traders all over the world, amateur and professional alike, earn a\nliving by using technical analysis to time their trades in many different mar-\nkets. They not only earn a living, but are also still standing after a market crash.\nIn this book, I try to explain how they do that, and how you can do it, too.\n\nAbout This Book\n\nThe technical analysis industry is positively blooming. Go to an Internet\nsearch engine and type in technical analysis, and you get over 45 million\nresponses. The phrase support and resistance results in over 10 million hits.\nOkay, everyone knows the limitations of Web searches, but even after weed-\ning out the mismatches, that’s still a huge amount of material. Don’t be intimi-\ndated. In this book, I include core concepts, some of which you can apply\ntoday with no further research.\n\nI want you to grasp the mindset of the technical trader or investor: To think\nindependently, to take responsibility for actions, and most of all, to act on\nobservation rather than conventional wisdom. Try to leave your preconcep-\ntions about trading and investing behind. For example, a core technical con-\ncept is that the technical trader cuts losses and lets the winning trades run.\nChances are you think that, after taking a loss, you should continue to hold\nthe security, because if it’s a true value investment, it’ll come back.\n\nBut try to think like a 10-year-old as you read this book. In fact, go find a\n10-year-old, if you have one handy, and ask him, “Which is better to hang on\nto: a thing that has already let you down (losses) or a different thing that’s\ndelivering exactly what you wanted (profits)?” See? Technical analysis is sub-\nversive that way.\n\nBeating the system is fun and rewarding. The market doesn’t know you, your\nage, gender, ethnicity, good looks or lack of them, singing talent, or anything\nelse about you except whether you're a successful trader. The market is\nblind.

Don’t feel that you have to \nread every chapter — or even the entire chapter. Take advantage of the table \nof contents and index to find what you’re looking for, and check it out.\nConventions Used in This Book\nTo help you navigate this book, I use the following conventions:\n \n✓ Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are \ndefined.\n \n✓ Boldfaced text is used to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or the \naction part of numbered steps.\n \n✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.\nWhat You’re Not to Read\nI intend for this book to be a pleasant and practical read so that you can \nquickly find and absorb the information you want. However, I sometimes \ncouldn’t help going a little bit deeper or relaying information that expands on \nthe basics. You might find this information interesting, but you don’t need it \nto understand what you came to that section to find.\nWhen you see a sidebar (a gray-shaded box of text) or text flagged with the \nTechnical Stuff icon, know that the information is optional. You can lead a full \nand happy life without giving it a glance. (But aren’t you curious? A little?)\nFoolish Assumptions\nEvery author must make assumptions about her audience, and I’ve made a \nfew assumptions that may apply to you:\n \n✓ You’ve never put a dime into a security but you plan to; and when you \ndo, you intend not to lose it.\n \n✓ You’re reasonably well versed in the trading game, but you’re looking for \nnew tools to become a more effective trader and improve your profits.\n \n✓ You’re tired of the buy-and-hold approach in which your returns seem \nunrelated to the supposed quality of the security you bought.\n \n✓ You want to find out how to sell. You know how to buy, but timing your \nsales ties you up in knots.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Parts I and II \nintroduce you to the field of technical analysis, and Parts III through V intro-\nduce you to nuts and bolts — the indicators. What’s that leave? The famous \nFor Dummies Part of Tens — Part VI.\nPart I: Defining Technical Analysis\nThe point of technical analysis is to help you observe prices in a new way \nand to make trading decisions based on reasonable expectations about \nwhere “the market” is going to take the price. This part shows you how to \nview security prices as the outcome of crowd psychology.\nPart II: Preparing Your Mind \nfor Technical Analysis\nBefore you plunge into risking hard-earned cash on securities trading, you have \nto realize that it’s not the security that counts; it’s the trade. Each trade has two \nparts — the price analysis and you. Price analysis tools are called indicators, and \nyou have to select the indicators that match your personality and preference \nfor risk. But most people don’t know their risk preference when they start out \nin securities trading (which changes over time, anyway), so you have a chicken-\nand-egg situation. By studying the kinds of profit and loss outcomes that each \ntype of indicator delivers, you can figure out your risk preferences.\nPart III: Observing Market Behavior\nThe price bar and its placement on the chart deliver a ton of information \nabout market sentiment. It doesn’t take much practice to start reading the \nmind of the market by looking at bars and small patterns. The payoff is cold, \nhard cash, but you have to be patient, imaginative, and thoughtful.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

With a little\npractice, you can quickly start throwing around technical jargon like support\nand resistance with the best of them. Better yet, this part provides the con-\ncepts you need to start making informed decisions.\n\nPart V: Flying with Dynamic Analysis\n\nThis part deals (mostly) with math-based indicators. Relax — it’s only arith-\nmetic. Math indicators are the workhorses of technical analysis. They help\nyou identify whether your price is trending, the strength of the trend, and\nwhen the trend is at a reversal point. Applying these indicators carefully and\nconsistently is the key to trading success. If you’re mathematically compe-\ntent, you can take a giant leap into system building, and remove most of the\nday-to-day judgmental decision making that trading involves.\n\nPart V1: The Part of Tens\n\nAs I say in Part I, there’s the trade, and then there’s you. You can be merely\ncompetent at using indicators and still achieve excellence as a trader. I show\nyou how in this part, by sharing ten rules that every top trader follows, ten\ntechnical things you can do that will help you make money trading, and ten\nways in which the market has changed. Finally, | include a brief listing of the\ntop resources to follow up on.\n\nIcons Used in This Book\n\nme\n\nar\n\nIcons are small pictures in the margins of this book that flag certain material\nfor you. The following icons highlight information you want to pay special\nattention to.\n\nWhen you see this icon, you don’t want to forget the accompanying info —\npretty subtle, huh?\n\nThis icon clues you in on hands-on time- and hassle-saving advice that you can\nput into practice.

Therefore, technical analysis dictates a more active trading style than\nyou may be used to.\n\nTrading or investing: The many\nfaces of technical analysis\n\nBoth traders and investors use technical analysis. So what’s the difference\nbetween a trader and an investor? Most people consider that a trader is\nsomeone who holds securities for only a short period of time, anywhere from\na minute to a year. An investor is someone who holds securities anywhere\nfrom many months to forever, depending on whom you ask. Holding period\nis not the only factor, though. You may think of an investor as someone who\nalso seeks income from dividends or bond coupon payments, and the timing\nof those payments influences the investor’s holding period, too.\n\nActually, the dividing line between trader and investor isn’t fixed (except for\npurposes of taxation). Be careful not to fall into the semantic trap of thinking\nthat a trader is a wild-eyed speculator while an investor is a respectable guy\nin a pinstriped suit. I use the word fader in this book, but don’t let it distract\nyou. People who consider themselves investors use technical methods, too.\n\nYou can use technical methods over any investment horizon, including the\nlong term. If you’re an expert in Blue Widget stock, for example, you can\n\nadd to your holdings when the price is relatively low, take some partial\nprofit when the price is relatively high, and dump it all if the stock crashes.\nTechnical analysis has tools for identifying each of these situations. You can\nalso use technical tools to rotate your capital among several securities, allo-\ncating more capital to the ones delivering the highest gains. At the other end\nof the investment horizon spectrum, you can use technical analysis to spot a\nhigh-probability trade and execute the purchase and sale in one hour.\n\nSetting new rules\n\nYou may have the preconceived notion that because technical analysis\nentails an active trading style, you're about to embark on a wild and risk-\nladen adventure — like the one-hour trade, for example. Nothing is further\nfrom the truth. Executing the one-hour trade has less inherent risk of loss\nthan buying and holding a security indefinitely without an exit plan. The exis-\ntence of an exit plan is what defines and limits the risk.\n\nThe one-hour trade entails risk management, whereas holding a security\nwithout an end in mind on some concept of hypothetical “value” is to take\n100 percent risk. That supposedly “valuable” security can quickly tank and go\nto zero. Think of Enron, WorldCom, Lehman Brothers, or Bear Stearns — all\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The technical analysis approach\nis demonstrably more risk averse than the value-investing approach.\n\nTo embrace technical analysis is to embrace a way of thinking that’s always\nsensitive to risk. Technical trading means to trade with a plan that identifies\nthe potential gain and the potential loss of every trade ahead of time. The\ntechnical trader devises rules for dealing with price developments as they\noccur in order to realize the plan. In fact, you select your technical tools\n(from the many available) specifically to match your trading style with your\nsensitivity to risk. I talk about this in Chapter 4.\n\nUsing rules is the key feature of lasting success in trading. Anybody can get\nlucky — once. To make profits consistently requires that you not only iden-\ntify the trading opportunity, but also manage the risk of the trade. Most of\nthe “trading rules” that you hear about, such as “Cut your losses and let your\nwinners run,” arise from the experience of technical traders. (I come back the\nsubject of managing the trade in Chapter 5.)\n\nMaking the case for managing the trade\n\nTo buy and hold securities for a very long period of time is a well-<locumented\npath to accumulating capital, but only if your timing is good and you got in at\nthe best time. Consider the following:\n\nIf you had bought U.S. stocks at the price peak just ahead of the 1929\nCrash, it would’ve taken you over 20 years to recover your initial capital.\n\nSince the end of World War II, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has\nfallen by more than 20 percent (a bear market — see the “Keeping your\nbulls and bears straight: A word about words” sidebar in this chapter)\non 12 occasions.\n\nFrom January 2000 to October 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 50 percent. If\nyou owned all the stocks in the S&P 500 and held them throughout the\nentire period, you lost 50 percent of your stake, which means you now\nneed to make a gain equivalent to 100 percent of your remaining capital\nto get your money back, as Table 1-1 shows. Ask yourself how often\nanyone makes a 100 percent return on investment.\n\nOil rose from $18.03 a barrel in November 2001 to $147.27 a barrel\nin July 2008, a gain of 720 percent. But if you bought at the high and\nexpected the gravy train to keep flowing, you faced a humungous loss as\noil fell to $33.87 by December 2008 — unless you exited.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Buying into an uptrend usually\nimproves the probability of making money, providing you can figure out\nat what price point to sell.\n\nPreserve capital: You tend to make fewer mistakes and preserve capital\nby not buying a security when the price is falling (a downtrend) — no\nmatter how charming the salesman or fascinating the story. In addition,\nyou preserve capital by selling your security when it starts downtrend-\ning. You don’t know where or when a downtrend might end.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n[Formulas: 1-1]",

Prices incorporate (or discounf) all known information, includ-\ning assumptions, about the security, and prices change as new information\nbecomes available. All known information consists of hundreds of factors\nranging from accurate facts to opinions, guesses, and emotions — and previ-\nous prices. They all go into the supply and demand for a security and result\nin its price. | talk about supply and demand in Chapter 2 and environmental\nfactors that affect the price in Chapter 3 as well as in Chapter 10.\n\nCharles Dow, one of the founders of The Wall Street Journal, observed around\nthe turn of the 20th century that no matter what the true facts are about a\nsecurity and what people are saying about it, the price neatly cuts through all\nthe clutter of words and is the one piece of hard information you can trust.\nNowadays traders have to qualify that statement with the caveat “unless the\ncomputers made an error.”\n\nNote, however, that prices on a chart don’t tell you anything about the under-\nlying value of the security. Where the price “should” be is a totally different\nsubject, named fundamental analysis. Most technical traders use both forms\nof analysis, because technical analysis isn’t antithetical to fundamental analy-\nsis, as some critics think. The two can be used together. You can choose to\ntrade only the highest-quality securities on a fundamental basis, but time\nyour purchases and sales according to technical criteria.\n\nTechnical analysis and fundamental analysis are compatible. The core ideas of\ntechnical analysis aren’t some new and crackpot flash in the pan, but rather,\nthey came into being over 100 years ago. Technical ideas have a respectable\norigin and have been embraced and explored by some very brainy and suc-\ncessful figures in American finance.\n\nCheck out the following basic observations underlying technical analysis that\nare attributed to Dow himself:\nSecurities prices move in trends much of the time.\n\nTrends can be identified with patterns that you see repeatedly (which I cover\nin Chapter 9) and with support and resistance trendlines (see Chapter 10).\n\nPrimary trends (lasting months or years) are punctuated by secondary\nmovements (lasting weeks or months) in the opposite direction of the\nprimary trend. Secondary trends, today called retracements, are the very\ndevil to deal with as a trader. (See Chapter 2 for more on retracements.)\n\nTrends remain in place until some major event comes along to stop them.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n13",

A key point to take away from knowing about Dow is that traders were\nusing technical ideas long before the advent of electronic communication and\nsoftware programs — technical analysis is hardly a new-fangled fad that will\nhave a short shelf life.

Trend is such a wide and \nflexible concept that a large variety of definitions is possible. In fact, to be \npragmatic, you can say that a trend is a price move that your indicator identi-\nfies. In other words, you can define trend according to technical measures \nthat appeal to your sense of logic and what works for you. In this book, defi-\nnitions of trendedness are spread out under various technique headings so \nthat you can choose which definition of trendedness suits your personality \nand trading style.\nQuantifying trendedness\nCreating a chart like the one in Figure 1-1 is easy. To illustrate classic trend \nbehavior, I could’ve taken any security out of thousands in my database and \nfound some period of time over which the security’s price looked like this \nchart. However, I could have also found many time periods when this same \nsecurity was not trending. In fact, some securities are frequently in a trend-\ning mode, others seldom trend, or their trends are short lived. To complicate \nmatters, some securities exhibit a “habit” of tidy trending while others trend \nin a sloppy way (with high variability around the average).\nCharles Dow may have started the ball rolling in technical analysis over 100 \nyears ago, but in the grand scheme of things, we’re still in frontier days. Ask \na group of technical traders, “What percentage of time are securities trend-\ning and what percentage of the time are they nontrending?” and you will get \na different answer from each person. Each technical analyst has a different \nidea about the percentage of time securities are trending based on his own \npersonal definition of trendedness and the time frame he looks at.\nChoosing a definition\nNo single definition of trendedness is the universal gold standard on which \neveryone agrees, so it’s hardly surprising that no one can say, “Securities are \ntrended x percent of the time.” Just about any generalization about trended-\nness can be demonstrated — or rebutted.\nFor example, I trade foreign exchange, and in my experience, the pound, the \neuro, and the yen are trended about 60 percent of the time. I say that because \n60 percent of the time, I can identify a directional bias by using my tools on \nmy time frames. However, someone else may say currencies are trended only \nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In fact, some analysts say foreign exchange prices are\nmean reverting 60 percent of the time (see Chapter 2 for the mean-reversion\nconcept) but I say “So what?” Mean reversion can coexist with trendedness\nand doesn’t affect my trading.\n\nOnly one thing is certain: No security trends all the time. Even the best-\nbehaved security spends some time going sideways (nontrending), which can\nbe considered a trend in its own right.\n\nI give you the key definitions of trendedness in Parts III through V. Chapter 6\ndescribes it as a series of higher highs together with a series of higher lows\n(for an uptrend). In Chapter 12, trendedness is defined as the price rising\nabove a moving average or a short-term moving average rising above a long-\nterm moving average (also an uptrend). The rest of the chapters contain\nother definitions, like the linear regression slope I mention at the beginning\nof this section.\n\nPicking a time frame\n\nIf you’re looking at ten years of daily prices, you get a different view of trend-\nedness than when you're looking at only two years of data. In other words,\nyou need to consider the time period of the data you analyze. A security may\ndisplay a trend on data captured every hour but appear to be nontrending\nwhen you look at daily data. Some securities may trend in the morning and\nnot in the afternoon. To go to the other extreme, you may not be able to\ndetect a trend on daily data but a weekly or monthly chart shows a trend.\nYou cannot say anything reasonable and useful about trends without specify-\ning the time frame.\n\nFurther, a security that trended in one period may not be trending in another.\nMarkets are dynamic. They change (then they change back). Accept it.\n\nEmbrace the spirit of empirical investigation embodied in technical research.\nWhen you're drawing charts, experiment with different time frames.\n\nDiscovering Why Technical Analysis\nDoes and Doesn’t (Always) Work\n\nPas\n\nTechnical analysis works because people consistently repeat behaviors under\nsimilar circumstances. For example, I say in Chapter 10 that support and resis-\ntance lines are a simple and effective method to identify the limits of a trend,\nand when a price breaks a support or resistance line, it’s called a breakout.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Because over decades of analysts follow-\ning prices, a breakout reliably signaled the end of a trend many, many times.\n\nWhile “breakout” is powerful, it isn’t always correct. You will run into situa-\n\ntions where a breakout is not respected and the price resumes the direction\nit was headed in the first place. In short, some breakouts are “false” — they\n\nlead you astray.\n\nThe biggest mistake that beginning technical traders make is attributing too\nmuch reliability and accuracy to technical methods. (Check out Chapter 3 for\nmore technical analysis forecasting method constraints.) Experienced tech-\nnical traders know that no technique works all the time. In fact, many tech-\nniques work only when the majority of market participants believe that they\nwill work, forming a self-fulfilling prophecy. As long as you can identify what\ntechnical theory has a grip on the market’s imagination at any one time, you\ndon’t need to care whether the theory is scientifically verifiable. Your goal is\nto make money, not to be scientifically pure.\n\nUnderstanding that no technique works all the time helps you overcome\ndoubts raised by critics who say that the whole field of technical analysis\n\nis not worthwhile because techniques are not 100 percent reliable. Because\na method doesn’t work all the time isn’t the right criterion for evaluating it.\nJust because the meteorologist is wrong 50 percent of the time doesn’t mean\nyou should take off in your Cessna when he’s forecasting a violent thunder-\nstorm in the next hour.\n\nIn financial markets, the value of an analytical method is determined by\nwhether it helps you to consistently make more money than you lose. Notice\nthat this statement has two components: The method and you. The “you” vari-\nable is why two traders — whether newcomers or grizzled old hands — can\nuse the same method but achieve very different results. (I discuss this puzzle\nin Chapter 17.)\n\nGeating the Market\n\nEvery day, hundreds of thousands of traders all over the world beat the\nmarket. To beat the market means to earn a return higher than the benchmark\nin that market, such as making more from trading a single stock included in\nthe Dow Industrial Average than the Dow Industrial Average index returned\nin the same period. Beating the market can also mean to earn a return greater\nthan the return on the return on a risk-free investment, usually defined as the\nthree-month U.S. Treasury bill.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "] 8 Part I: Defining Technical Analysis\n\nPas\n\nTechnical analysis is about making extraordinary gains — beating the market —\nand if you think that isn’t possible, you haven’t looked hard enough. Many\npeople try to beat the market and fail. Almost everyone knows the story of\nthe hapless day traders of the 1990s who deluded themselves into thinking\nthat they possessed trading secrets when all they had was a roaring bull\nmarket. A few survived — because they adapted their trading techniques to\nthe changing market. To trade well is a skill that takes training, practice, and\nbenefiting from mistakes, just like any other business. You wouldn’t open a\nrestaurant without knowing how to cook, but somehow people think they can\ntrade securities without understanding how and why prices move.\n\nWhether you just want to get out ahead of another crash, sharpen your trad-\ning skills, or aspire to become a self-supporting trader, use your noggin: This\nbusiness is going to take some sweat — and some hard choices. You may be\ndisappointed to discover that technical analysis doesn’t offer a single, coher-\nent path to market wisdom. You'd think that after 100 years of development,\ntraders would have a rule book with a single set of steps to take and pro-\ncesses to go through. But they don’t.\n\nWhy not? For the same reason that you can find ten equally good ways to cook\nan omelet. Each cook selects a different pan, whisking and stirring techniques,\namount of salt, amount of heat, and so on. Likewise in trading, each trader sees\na different amount of risk on any particular chart, chooses one set of indica-\ntors over another, and has a taste for taking a certain amount of profit (or loss)\nfor the capital at stake. Just as no one can dictate a single right way to cook an\nomelet, no one can name the single best way to trade a particular price situa-\ntion. Theoretically, you could say that the best way is the way that makes the\nmost money, but that fails to account for the trader — his personality, goals,\nand experience — and how much money he has to risk.\n\nTo blend technical methods with your own personal risk profile isn’t the\n\nwork of one day. It’s a lengthy and difficult process that requires some soul-\nsearching. To keep the process manageable, confine your conclusions to what\nyou can observe and verify — the empirical approach. Be careful to avoid the\nerror of composition, like reading that one set of technical traders believes in\nmagic numbers and concluding that all of technical analysis involves magic\nnumbers. (It doesn’t.) It’s astonishing how many otherwise smart people mis-\njudge technical analysis in exactly this manner, and in widely reviewed books,\nbased on an incomplete understanding of the field. Many critics take one tech-\nnical idea, fail to integrate it with their personal risk profile, and then blame all\nof technical analysis for their losses.\n\nAnother error to avoid is the overly scientific approach. Like the expert who\nproved that the Bernoulli principle is mathematically wrong and therefore\nairplanes can’t fly, probability experts say they can prove prices are random.\nRandom numbers do throw up patterns, the argument goes, so technical\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

And yet you do see orderliness, and you can\nexploit it, at least enough of the time to beat the market. Traders have been prof-\niting from technical methods for over a hundred years — longer, if you count\n17th-century candlestick charting (for more on this method, see Chapter 8).\n\nFinding Order\n\nPas\n\nMuch of the time you can see order in the way securities prices evolve, even\nthough they develop in an infinite variety of configurations and each chart\n\nis literally unique. Technical traders attribute that orderliness to the swings\nof market sentiment. Prices form patterns because the traders in the market\nbehave in regular and repetitive ways. You can identify, measure, and project\nprices because you can identify, measure, and project human behavior. Most\npeople can do it only imperfectly, but you and I can both do it.\n\nProbably the most intriguing thing about technical analysis is that ideas and\ninsights about price behavior from 1900 are as fresh and valuable today as\nthey were then. Technical analysis never throws anything out — it just finds\nmore-efficient ways to capture price moves. Since the personal computer\ncame along, technical analysis has become more math oriented, but the\nessence of technical analysis is still to grasp the underlying human behavior\nthat makes prices move.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, technical analysis is a fairly new field of\nendeavor, and still changing. Traders like you and me have a lot to master.\nThe few things technical traders do know for certain include the following:\n\nNo technique works all the time.\nNo technique works on every security.\n\nSomething mysterious is going on that traders don’t yet understand. A\nfamous trader named Bernard Baruch said\n\nHave you ever seen, in some wood, on a sunny quiet day, a cloud of flying\nmidges — thousands of them — hovering, apparently motionless, in a sun-\nbeam?... Yes?... Well, did you ever see the whole flight — each mite appar-\nently preserving its distance from all others — suddenly move, say three feet,\nto one side or the other? Well, what made them do that? A breeze? I said a\nquiet day. But try to recall — did you ever see them move directly back again\nin the same unison? Well, what made them do that? Great human mass move-\nments are slower in inception but much more effective.\n\nThis phenomenon is what technical analysis seeks to explain.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "20 Part |: Defining Technical Analysis\n\nViewing the Scope of Technical Analysis\n\nar\n\nTechnical analysis focuses on prices. Analyzing prices can take many differ-\nent forms — from drawing lines on a chart by hand to using high-powered\ncomputer software to calculate the most likely path of a price out of all pos-\nsible paths. Technical analysis is sometimes called by other names, such as\ncharting, market timing, and trend-following. The press, the public, and even\ntechnical-analysis authors all use these terms interchangeably.\n\nWhen you see these terms in this book and elsewhere, don’t fret over a strict\ninterpretation — and don’t accept or reject a technical idea because it has a\nparticular label. You can put ten technical traders in a room and get ten defini-\ntions of each term. The following sections are my interpretation of these terms\nand their nuances.\n\nCharting\n\nCharting is probably the oldest generic term used for technical analysis. I\ncover “charting” techniques in Parts III and IV. Charting refers to reading\nsupply and demand into bars and patterns. Some technical analysts reject\nthe term charting because it harkens back to the days of colored pencils and\nrulers. They see charting as subjective, while statistics-based indicators\n(which I cover in Part V) are “objective.” But many traders use charting con-\nventions developed over decades, and they work. I think charting gets you\ncloser to the supply-demand dynamics (the “mind of the market”) than math-\nbased indicators that quantify market sentiment in a more abstract way.\n\nMarket timing\n\nMarket timing is another term used in place of fechnical analysis. All techni-\n\ncal trading involves timing, but to my way of thinking, the term market timing\nrefers to statistical analysis that goes beyond a single chart. It encompasses\nmany techniques, such as sentiment indicators and calendar effects, that many\nself-described chartists say aren’t charting and at least some technical analysts\nsay aren’t technical analysis. | cover these and other tools in Chapter 3.\n\nTrend-following (there’s that word again)\n\nThe very first thing you look for in a chart is whether the price is trending.\nBecause so much emphasis is put on the presence or absence of a trend,\ntechnical analysis is sometimes named ¢rend-following. Parts IV and V con-\ntain techniques that are trend-following. Some analysts object to the term\nbecause you aren’t always following, but often anticipating, a trend such as\nwhen you use momentum indicators (see Chapter 13).\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "21\n Chapter 1: Opening the Technical Analysis Toolbox\nTechnical analysis\nTechnical analysis is the broadest of the terms. It covers hand-drawn lines \nas well as grand theories of price cycles. In short, technical analysis is a term \nencompassing all the tricks and techniques.\nTechnical analysis is not confined to just math-based techniques, as some \nfolks may think. Using math is a breakthrough and a curse. Math may out-\nperform human judgment and the human eye, as many an optical illusion \nhas proved, but it’s not true that numbers never lie. Numbers lie all the time \nin price analysis! You can have a textbook-perfect trend with ten confirming \nindicators, and it can still run into a brick wall — really bad news that trashes \nthe price of the security. Math can never overcome the inconvenient fact that \nfresh news, which no one can predict, may overwhelm any price trend.\nKeeping your bulls and bears straight: \nA word about words\nA bullish market is one that is rising, and a \nbearish market is one that is falling. A bull is an \noptimist who thinks prices will rise; a bear is a \npessimist who thinks prices will fall. Bull and \nbear are oversimplifications. But those words \nare commonly used in discussing securities \nmarkets. Accept them. The word bull applies \nto the long-term holder as well as the in-and-\nout quick-trade artist. The point is that bull and \nbear, or bullish and bearish, are useful short-\nhand words that summarize market players and \nmarket sentiment as either positive and optimis-\ntic (prices will rise) or negative and pessimistic \n(prices will fall).\nA lot of people don’t like those words, finding \nthem to be coarse, undignified, and often inac-\ncurate. When you buy a security for an expected \nlong-term holding period, you feel positive about \nthe security, but the word bullish sounds emo-\ntional and doesn’t describe the deeply intellec-\ntual process you went through in selecting that \nparticular security. When you sell a security, you \nmay not appreciate being named a bear. You \nmay not have had a negative attitude toward that \nsecurity — you just wanted the money from the \nsale for some other purpose.\nSome critics complain that technical analysis \nuses far too much jargon that is not intuitively \nobvious, and sometimes just plain ridiculous \n(although bull and bear are not confined to \ntechnical analysis). The only answer is that \nevery field has its lingo, and I introduce it as \ngently as possible. When you take a course in \ncooking, you have to understand the meaning of \nsauté, blanch, and braise. The lingo of techni-\ncal analysis is no more difficult or silly than the \nlingo of fine cooking.\nBut it does have some additional problems. Not \neverybody agrees on word usage. A bearish \nmarket is one in which prices are falling. It rises \nto the status of bear market (no -ish) when it \nhas fallen by 20 percent or more from a peak for \na sustained period. A bull market is one that has \nrisen at least 20 percent for a sustained period \nfrom a major low. Some writers, even experts, \ncall any big move a bull or bear market when \nthey should use a more-careful phrase, such as \n“the market has a bullish tone.” In short, market \ncommentators are prone to exaggeration and \nsloppy use of language. Be aware of this short-\ncoming. Check the facts before you go bulling \nor bearing your way through the market.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Next, an outcome of crowd behav-\nior is the tendency of prices to cluster around the average, even when the\naverage is trending. It’s useful to identify clustering, in part to know when\n\nto heed the prices that stray from the cluster. Also, a large group of techni-\ncal traders think that crowd behavior fits a particular model based on a\nsequence of numbers called the Fibonacci sequence.

    "text": "24\nPart I: Defining Technical Analysis \nSecurities aren’t socks: The demand effect\nSecurities are different from cars, bread, and socks. You don’t buy a security \nfor the joy of owning it and using it. You can’t drive it, eat it, or wear it. Aside \nfrom getting a dividend or coupon payment, the only reason to buy a security \nis to sell it again, preferably for more than you paid for it. Unless you’re a \nmerchant, you hardly ever buy anything with the idea of selling it again — \nexcept securities.\nIn standard economic thinking, the law of supply and demand states that \ndemand for an item depends on its price, which is a function of scarcity. If \nsomething is rare, it’s expensive. At higher and higher prices, demand falls \noff. At some point, the high price induces suppliers to produce more of the \nthing, whereupon the price falls. Equilibrium consists of demanders and sup-\npliers finding the mix of quantity and price that both parties find acceptable. \nThis process is called price discovery, and it can take time.\nIn contrast, in securities trading, the pricing process is like the pricing pro-\ncess in an auction. For one thing, prices move a lot faster. Plus, in an auction \n(such as the online auctioneer eBay), demand for the item often rises as the \nprice rises. If you ever participated in an auction, you probably paid more for \nsomething than you should have. But you just couldn’t let the other guy win, \nright? Every time someone else outbids you, you want the item more than \never and become determined to be the winner. The intrinsic value of the item \ndoesn’t matter. Sound familiar? You may even have an object or two in the \nhall closet you’re ashamed of having bought at an auction. I certainly do.\nIn an auction (whether live or online), what gets your blood running is that \nsomeone else also wants to buy the item in question. Visible demand begets \nmore demand. Auction economics are contrary to what traditional econom-\nics teaches — that demand will decrease as the price rises. In the auction \nsituation, demand increases as the price rises. The item may or may not be \nactually scarce in the real world. It doesn’t matter.\nThe immediacy of the auction is what skews prices, sometimes to absurd \nlevels. Later, when suppliers see the high prices, they may indeed be able \nto find or produce more of the item — but by then, the specific demand \ndynamic of that one auction is gone.\nCreating demand from scratch\nWhen you are wearing your investor hat, you may buy stocks and bonds \nchiefly to get the dividend or the interest rate coupon, with capital gain on \nthe price a secondary consideration. When you are wearing your trader hat, \nyou buy a security because you think the price will rise. You decide to sell \nbecause you have a profit that meets your needs or because you have taken \nan intolerable loss. You seldom think about the true supply of the security.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Pas\n\nChapter 2: Uncovering the Essence of Market Movement 2 5\n\nWhile, technically, the supply of any security is limited by the number of\nshares outstanding and the like, supply may be considered infinite for all\npractical purposes. If you really have to have 100 shares of Blue Widget\nstock, some price you can offer will get you those shares. Turn it around, and\nyou can easily see why. A price exists at which you can be induced to sell the\nstock for which you paid $10. It might be $20, or $200, or $10,000 — but rest\nassured, some price will force you to part with it, and right now.\n\nIn technical trading, think of demand for a security as rising on rising prices,\nnot falling ones. Similarly, the supply of a security dries up on rising prices,\nat least in the short run. (Later, when the long-term security holder sees how\nhigh the price has gone while he wasn’t looking, he may say “Holy Toledo!”\nand call his broker to sell, making more supply available.)\n\nIdentifying Crowd Behavior\n\nPas\n\nPas\n\nTechnical analysis is the art of identifying crowd behavior in order to join\n\nthe crowd and take advantage of its momentum. This phenomenon is called\nthe bandwagon effect. (A subset of the bandwagon effect is named momentum\ninvesting, which I talk about in Chapter 13.) Here’s how a bandwagon works:\n\nA fresh piece of news comes out. Many traders (or a few with deep pockets)\ninterpret the news as favorable to the security, and buying overwhelms selling\nso that the price rises. You profit by going with the flow. Then when everyone\nis jumping off the bandwagon, you should jump, too.\n\nTraders are people, and people often behave in predictable ways. When it\ncomes to emotions like fear and greed, people today are not so different from\npeople 100 years ago or maybe even 1,000 years ago. People become reckless\nand irrational in a mania. They become overly cautious after a bubble bursts. A\nmania is a situation in which traders buy an object or security without regard\nfor its intrinsic value or even whether they'll be able to sell it again later at a\nhigher price. They fear being left out of an opportunity. They’re caught up in\nthe moment and temporarily irrational. A panic is the opposite — people can’t\nsell the thing fast enough and will accept ever-lower prices just to get any\nmoney back at all.\n\nIn economic history, a mania or a panic comes along only a few times ina\ncentury. However, in the technical world, mania and panic happen every day,\nin miniature. Emotional extremes lead to price extremes in the context of the\nhour, day, or week — minimanias and minipanics occur all the time. Those\nwords aren’t used in technical trading lingo, but the emotion and the price\neffects are the same as in big-picture manias and panics.

    "text": "26\n\nPart I: Defining Technical Analysis\n\nThe individual versus the crowd\n\nPeople behave differently as individuals from the way they act when they’re\npart of a crowd. Crowd behavior encompasses fraternities, sports teams, politi-\ncal parties, gangs, religious sects, mobs, people attending an auction — the\n\nlist goes on. A crowd is more than the sum of its parts. Otherwise sensible\nindividuals can behave in the most extraordinary ways when they become\npart of a crowd. One famous case is how people in 17th-century Holland saw\ntulipmania, the trading of tulip bulbs for sums like $250,000, deflate overnight\nwhen someone mistakenly ate one, revealing how ridiculously far prices had\ndiverged from any reasonable concept of value.\n\nYou know that if someone shouts, “Fire!” in a crowded theater, people will\ntrample each other to get to the exits. In markets, you see the same thing in\nthe price of a security when bad news about it is released. Also, if someone\nshouts, “Free ice cream!” people will throw elbows at anyone just to be first\nin line. The same thing happens to securities prices as they reach new highs,\nespecially if an authority figure pronounces the security a gem and a bargain.\n\nDon’t be surprised when traders invent rumors to try to create a stampede —\nin either direction. As a technical trader, you want to be sensitive to what the\ncrowd is doing without succumbing to the ruling passions of the crowd itself.\nTechnical traders work hard at not listening to chatter about securities, even\nfrom experts. You may get information overload — and you may get disinfor-\nmation (deliberately misleading information). All the information you need to\nmake a trading decision is embedded in the price. The price incorporates the\ncrowd reaction to information, and it’s more practical to look at prices than\nto guess what the crowd might be thinking. When you check the news for the\ncause of a price action, do it with a healthy dose of skepticism.\n\nPlaying games with traders’ heads\n\nThe market is self-regarding — it watches itself. One behavior begets another\nin a dynamic way. For example, many advisors recommend a rule that ifa\nprice falls by x percent from a peak, it’s prudent to exit the trade. William\nO'Neil of Investor’s Business Daily made the 8 percent rule popular. Famous\ninvestor Gerald Loeb and others used the 10 percent rule. Other advisors rec-\nommend a 25 percent rule. Because these rules are so well known, many trad-\ners use then and cause the rule to be self-fulfilling. Traders know that others\nwill exit at a level of (say) 8 to 10 percent or 25 percent under the peak, and\nwill sell the security specifically to get everyone else to exit, whereupon\nthey’re able to buy the security at a cheaper price. Activities like this reveal\nthe game-playing aspect of trading.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Note that many top traders are also top competi-\ntors in fencing, chess, backgammon, bridge, and poker. Each security or class\nof securities has a different degree of crowd complexity. The crowd that\ntrades the S&P e-mini futures contract is different from the crowd that trades\nthe soybeans futures contract, and in turn, that crowd is different from the\none that trades the Swiss franc and the one that trades IBM stock.\n\nai? Each security has its own crowd, and you will get a payoff if you can figure out\nwhat pushes the buttons of the crowd that trades your security. One crowd\nmay always respect a support line, for example, while others enjoy breaking\nthe support line by just a little to induce selling so they can buy at a cheaper\nprice. (For more on support lines, see Chapter 10.) In foreign exchange (FX),\nthe Elliott Wave theory has a grip on many traders’ imaginations. You may\nthink the theory is ridiculous, but you still want to know the wave count and\nthe retracement levels in order to know that the FX crowd is thinking. See\n“The Elliott Wave principle” sidebar in this chapter.\n\nFiguring Out What's Normal: Considering\nthe Normal Distribution\n\nEach crowd, whether a fraternity or a gang, develops criteria for normal\nbehavior, such as wearing certain colors or having a secret vocabulary.\n\nIn trading, the crowd that trades a specific security has a firm grip on the\nnormal daily high-low trading range and can easily and quickly spot any\nbig price move beyond that normal range. (I cover the high and the low in\nChapter 6 and the average range in Chapter 7.)\n\nThis section describes how to identify what is “normal” and outlines a trad-\ning technique that some traders use. I think it’s equally useful to identify\nwhat is normal in order to be able to spot what is “abnormal” — in other\nwords, what constitutes an extreme. Alas, I have to throw in a few math\nterms, but fear not. You can easily wrestle the concepts to the ground.\n\nReverting to the mean\n\nThe phrase reversion fo the mean refers to a statistical concept that accepts\nas its core assumption that high and low prices are temporary and a price\nwill tend to go back to its average over time. The first step is to identify\n\nthe normal trading range of the security, say $5 per day. (For more on the\ntrading range, see Chapter 7.) You can observe that the price varies by\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n27",

Therefore, if the current price is $17.50, that’s half of the normal trad-\ning range below the average price and a buying opportunity. If the price is\n$22.50, that’s half of the average trading range above the average and a sell-\ning opportunity. If prices are normally distributed, you can buy at $17.50 and\nsell at $22.50 for a $5 profit. In other words, deviations from the average price\nare expected to revert to the average.\n\nOkay, here it comes — I just introduced a fancy word, deviation. The concept\nof deviation (and its cousin, standard deviation) is not as hard as it sounds.\nWhen discussing the idea of normal distribution and deviation from normal\ndistribution, textbooks use the height of a group of people in a room. The\naverage height is (say) 5 feet 8 inches, with some short people distributed\nout on the left-hand side at 4 feet 10 inches and some tall people out on the\nright-hand side at 6 feet 4 inches. The height measurement of the majority\nof people, about 67 percent, falls near the center, while the very short and\nvery tall cases are out near the edges, called the fails. In this example, the\n“normal” height is 5 feet 8 inches — it’s the average, and the normal range\nis 4 feet 10 inches to 6 feet 4 inches. In this crowd, you would instantly spot\nsomeone who was 3 feet 2 inches or someone who was 7 feet 10 inches.\n\nPrices clustered around the average are normal and represent the market\nconsensus of the rough equilibrium price for that day. The prices farther\naway from the normal price tend to deviate by only one unit from the average\nin each direction: higher or lower. This unit is named a standard deviation.\nFrankly, that’s all you need to know about the standard deviation — it’s a\nunit of measurement that describes how far away from an average higher or\nlower prices are likely to fall, based on the past distribution of highs and lows\nagainst a past average.\n\nThe one standard deviation region is symmetrical. When you use the normal\ndistribution concept, you assume that an equal number of prices will fall on\neach side of the average. This assumption isn’t always true, of course. Prices\nare trended at least some of the time, and so if the price is on a generally\nrising trend, expect to see the distribution curve skewed to one side, toward\nthe higher prices. You'll also see days in which the prices form a double\nhump or are just flat across the daily range.\n\nTrading mean reversion\n\nTo trade the concept of mean reversion means that you find an average price\nover some past period, figure out the high-low range, and simply buy when\nthe price has deviated to the low side of the range and sell when it gets to the\nhigh side.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "29\n Chapter 2: Uncovering the Essence of Market Movement\nDoes this sound too good to be true? Well, it is. Mean-reversion trading \nideas have the appearance of applying basic statistical concepts to securi-\nties prices to derive trading rules, but mean-reversion trading faces severe \nobstacles, such as:\n \n✓ What is the ideal lookback period to determine the average? Say, for \nexample, that Blue Widget stock over the past two years averaged $20 — \nbut that $20 average incorporates a few abnormal prices like $1 and $40. \nAn average can disguise multiple deviations that have already occurred.\n \n✓ Is it true that securities prices are normally distributed? Statisticians \nsay that securities prices are not actually normally distributed — they \njust look that way sometimes. In technical analysis, your primary goal \nis to determine whether your security exhibits a price trend. You also \nwant to know how strong the trend is and whether it might be ending \nsoon. To accept the assumption that the distribution of prices will be \nnormal is the same thing as saying that you know in advance where the \nprice trend will end — at or near the price represented by the average \nplus one standard deviation. If the price goes higher than the price that \none standard deviation dictates, the trading rule embedded in the mean-\nreversion trading technique would have you sell.\n \n You consider the security “overpriced” on a statistical basis. And yet \nyou can’t be sure that the other traders in the market performed exactly \nthe same analysis as you did. Even if they are using the mean-reversion \nconcept, maybe they used a different lookback period to calculate the \naverage. Because the other traders in this security don’t see the security \nas overpriced, they may keep buying, and buying, and buying — push-\ning the price to the equivalent of the guy in the room standing 7 feet 10 \ninches. The opposite is true, too. The mean-reversion process would not \nidentify the situation where the price keeps going to zero.\nIdentifying and Responding \nto Crowd Extremes\nStatistical analysis cannot capture the nuances of crowd behavior. One way to \nget a handle on crowd behavior is to master the key terms referring to crowd \nbehavior. These terms range from general trading-lore descriptions to words \nthat are specific to technical analysis. Notice that most of the lingo applies to \ncrowd extremes. These words and phrases, whether old news or brand-new to \nyou, are important as you navigate the technical trading waters.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "30 Part I: Defining Technical Analysis\n\nPas\n\nReady to dive right in? Here’s what you need to know:\n\nAccumulation: As market participants get excited about a security, they\n\nbecome increasingly bullish and either buy for the first time or add to\npositions, a phase named accumulation.\n\nDistribution: When traders become disillusioned about the prospect of\n\ntheir security price rising, they sell, a stage called distribution.\n\nChanging your position: To buy 100 shares of a stock is to enter a posi-\n\ntion. To buy another 100 shares for a total of 200 is to add to your posi-\ntion. If you have 500 shares and sell half, you would be reducing your\nposition. To sell all the shares you own is to square your position. When\nyou're square (also called flat), you have no position in the security. All\nyour money is in cash. You're neutral. (I talk more about changing your\nposition in Chapter 5.)\n\nToo far: After traders have been accumulating the security on rising\n\nprices, eventually the price goes too far. Too far is a relative term and can\nbe defined in any number of equally valid ways. In the mean-reversion\ncase in the “Reverting to the mean” section in this chapter, too far would\nbe a price of $32.50 when the normal distribution would cap the highest\nprice at $22.50.\n\nIf you like to draw support and resistance lines (for more info, see\nChapter 10), foo far is a level beyond the lines, a breakout. If you're of a\nstatistical bent, you will determine that foo far lies just outside a band\nconstructed from the average true range, two standard deviations away\nfrom a moving average (called a Bollinger Band), or some other nonjudg-\nmental measure. See Chapter 14 for a description of those techniques.\n\nGreaching the limits: Overbought\nand oversold\n\nWhen a price has reached or surpassed a normal limit defined by an indicator,\nthat price is at an extreme. In an up move, everyone who wanted to buy has\nalready bought. In this case, you can say that the market is overbought, a term\nspecific to securities trading. In a down move, when everyone who wanted to\nsell has already sold, the security is called oversold.\n\nTechnical traders apply the concepts of overbought and oversold to market\nindices as well as individual securities. Overbought and oversold are usually\nmeasured by the momentum indicators, which I cover in Chapter 13.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Pas\n\nChapter 2: Uncovering the Essence of Market Movement 3 ]\n\nNotice that the terms overbought and oversold are applied to the security,\nbut what the terms secretly refer to is how much money the traders in that\nsecurity have available at the moment. By the time most of the market par-\nticipants have jumped on the bandwagon, the wagon has become so heavy it\ncan’t move forward. Traders are tapped out. All their money is in a position.\nTraders have to get out of their positions just to put cash back into their\npockets so they can conduct additional trades.\n\nPosition squaring is the closing of positions after a big price move. Position\nsquaring doesn’t necessarily imply that market participants think a move is\nover. They may plan to reenter the security in the same direction later on.\n\nPosition squaring occurs for many reasons, including the following:\n\nTraders think that the move is exhausted for the moment.\nTraders have met a price objective — whether profit or loss.\n\nv Traders have met a time limit, such as the end of the day, week, month,\nor tax period.\n\nTraders want to withdraw money from the security to trade a different\nsecurity, or for a non-trading purpose.\n\nPosition squaring occurs when a large number of traders have big losses, too.\nSay, for example, a high percentage of traders believe in a particular price-\nmove scenario that then fails to develop in the expected way. Eventually, a\nfew traders throw in the towel. The resulting change in prices causes bigger\nlosses for the remaining traders, and they, in turn, give up. You get a suc-\ncession of stop-loss orders being hit that turns into a down-market rout, or\neven a panic. A sfop-loss order is an order you give to your broker to sell your\nposition if it goes against you too far and reaches the maximum loss you’re\nprepared to accept. (I talk about stop-loss orders in Chapter 5.)\n\nGoing against the grain: Retracements\n\nWhen a price has gone too far and traders deem the security overbought\n\nor oversold, the price stops rising or falling. It doesn’t just stop, though,\nand hover at a particular level. As nature abhors a vacuum, traders abhor\nan unmoving price. Instead, the price moves in the opposite direction for a\nwhile, as traders take profits or cut losses, as the case may be. As I mention\nin Chapter 1, a move in the opposite direction of the main trend is named a\nretracement. A retracement is also called a correction, which explicitly recog-\nnizes that the security had gone too far and is now correcting course, like a\nship. A retracement may also be termed a pullback or throwback.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "32\n\nPart I: Defining Technical Analysis\n\navr\n\nBER\n\nPrices seldom move in one direction for long. Even a major trend exhibits\nretracements. When the market runs out of cash, traders have to close posi-\ntions to get their cash back so they can put on new trades. If they’ve been\nbuyers, they need to sell. If they’ve been sellers (shorting the security), they\nneed to buy. Therefore, at the extreme outside limit of a price move, you\nshould expect a temporary, minor reversal of the previous price move. In an\nuptrend, a retracement is always a drop in price. In a downtrend, a retrace-\nment is always a rise in price. Position squaring generally causes a price move\nin the opposite direction of the trend.\n\nRetracements can get out of hand and transform themselves into trend rever-\nsals, too. At the time a retracement starts, you don’t know for sure that it is a\nretracement. For all you know, it could be a full reversal, with the price switch-\ning directions. In this situation, you do well to check the fundamentals — the\nnews and events pertaining to the security. An ordinary retracement caused\nby normal position squaring can suddenly turn into a full-fledged rout in the\nopposite direction if fresh news comes out that seems to support a reversal.\nBut also remember that sometimes big traders try to trick you into thinking\nthey have interpreted fresh news in a particular way, when all they’re trying to\ndo is push a retracement farther so that they can stampede you into a trading\naction that is to their benefit.\n\nIn Figure 2-1, the chart shows a primary trend with several retracements,\neach outlined by an ellipse. In this instance, the retracements last only a day\nor two, but retracements can last a lot longer, even several weeks on a daily\nchart, for example.\n\nThe press often asserts that every retracement is a profit-taking correction.\nThis assumption isn’t accurate. If traders took profit on every correction,\nthey'd all be rich. Remember, somebody bought at the high. If the correction\ngoes too far against him, he must get out of the position at a loss. From this\nobservation you should deduce that to stick to a position when it is correcting\nagainst you requires the courage of your convictions — and capital. (I talk\nmore about managing money during retracements in Chapter 5.)\n\nCatch a falling knife: Estimating where\nand when a retracement will stop\n\nTo try to estimate where a retracement will stop is called “to catch a falling\nknife.” In other words, no reliable rules exist to tell you where a trend correc-\ntion will end or when the primary trend will resume. One of the chief uses of\nindicators and combined indicators, described in Chapter 16, is to get guid-\nance on where and when a retracement will stop.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

If the security you want to trade regularly retraces 50 percent\nand the prospect of losing 51 percent turns you into a nervous wreck, you\nneed to trade it in a different time frame — or find another security.\n\nAcknowledging that no one can forecast a retracement hasn’t stopped tech-\nnical traders from trying to establish forecast rules. The following rules are\ngenerally helpful, but no one can offer reliable statistics to back them up, so\ntake them with a grain of salt.\n\n Aretracement won’t exceed a significant prior high or low. In Figure 2-1,\nfor example, the second retracement doesn’t challenge the lowest low\nof the first dip, and the third retracement doesn’t challenge the second.\nThis is cold comfort, because knowing where it won’t go doesn’t help you\nfigure out where it will go.\n\nLook for round numbers. Research shows that support and resistance\nlevels (see Chapter 10) actually do occur more often at round numbers\nthan chance would allow.\n\nThe 30 percent rule. Measure the percentage change and assume that a\nmajority of traders will place stops to avoid losing more than x percent,\nsuch as 30 percent.

Logically, you should assume\nthat they’re protecting 70 percent of their personal cash gain from their\nentry, not from the peak. To measure from the peak would be to say that\ntraders make decisions based on opportunity loss rather than cash loss,\nand while this contains a germ of truth, its not a reliable assumption\nabout crowd behavior. (The germ of truth lies in people feeling worse\nif they expected to get $10 and got only $1, compared to how they feel\nif they expected to get $5 and got only $1, as shown by behavioral eco-\nnomics — see the sidebar “Empiricists, 1: Academics, 0.”)\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The gambler’s fallacy is\nthe most famous example — in a coin toss, after\nheads comes up 50 times in a row, just about\neverybody will bet on tails, ignoring that the coin\ndoesn't remember which way it fell lasttime and\nthe probability of heads is still 50 percent.

Eventually this work will lead to a coherent\ntheory of crowd behavior.\n\nGig-Picture Crowd Theories\n\nSome important ideas about the extent of retracements come from theories\nabout the cyclical nature of history. This section deals with these ideas as a\nstand-alone section because they’re pervasive — and controversial.\n\nWhen you start gathering technical analysis material, you inevitably run into\nbig-picture crowd theories, a school of thought that is very popular today.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But just as beauty is in the eye\nof the beholder, theories about the ebb and flow of history are just that —\ntheories. No big-picture theory has been proved by statistical measures. To\nbe fair, no theory has been disproved, either.\n\nTechnical analysis is a sufficiently crowded field already and offers a bewilder-\ning variety of tools and techniques. Why make things more complicated than\nthey have to be? If you use the empirical evidence in front of you — clean and\neasy techniques like drawing support and resistance lines, for example — you\ncan use technical analysis to make profits and avoid losses. Do you really need\nto know the secrets of the universe, too? My heartfelt advice to the beginner\nis, “Don’t go there.”\n\nBut you need to know that these ideas are scattered throughout the field of\ntechnical analysis and some smart and successful people in the field believe\nthem. Those who don’t are mostly too polite to ridicule the ideas. You'll also\nrun into critics who mistakenly think that all technical analysis involves big-\npicture crowd ideas. So buckle your seat belt.\n\nSome analysts subscribe to the idea that in the ebb and flow of human affairs,\nthey can perceive cycles, including market cycles. Some of these ideas con-\ntain mystical overtones and unproven claims about how the world works,\nsuch as “the trading crowd is only the instrument of bigger forces at work.”\n\nBecause these ideas can never be verified, some critics unfairly color the\nwhole field of technical analysis with the charge of supernatural voodoo.\nEmpiricists and skeptics cast doubt on these theories because they’re not\nproven and by their nature, can’t be proven. In particular, economics offers\nno theoretical basis for cycles that are fixed in size or duration. Economists\ndo observe business cycles — several of them — but they overlap and don’t\nappear regularly. It is undeniable, however, that retracements do occur some-\ntimes near the levels forecasted by market cycle theorists such as J.M. Hurst,\nwho has a large following. As a result, technical traders are reluctant to level\nthe charge of crackpot against cycle theories.\n\nThe Gann 50 percent retracement\n\nIn the early 1900s, a trader named W.D. Gann discovered that retracements\nin the securities he was trading at the time tended to occur at one-half of the\noriginal move from the low to the high. To illustrate, say the price moved\nfrom $10 to $30. At $30, the crowd decided that the security was overbought\nand started to sell. The ensuing price decline, the retracement, stops near 50\npercent of the original $10 to $30 move, namely $20. See Figure 2-2. This chart\nshows the 50 percent retracement case.\n\nIn fact, Gann said that the most profitable retracement is a 50 percent\nretracement. The area around 50 percent is a danger zone, because the price\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But it’s the best place to reenter an existing trend\n(with an exit planned just below using a stop-loss order in case it doesn’t\nwork). If the trend resumes, Gann wrote that it will then exceed the previous\nhigh, which gives you an automatic minimum profit target. This observation\nmay be the origin of the phrase, “Buy on the dip.”\n\nGann also saw retracements occurring at the halfway point of a move, such\nas 25 percent (half of 50 percent), 12.5 percent (half of 25 percent), and so on.\nStatisticians can’t offer proof that retracements occur at 12.5 percent,\n\n25 percent, or 50 percent with more frequency than chance would allow. The\nabsence of statistical proof in a field populated by mathematical sophisti-\ncates is puzzling at first.\n\nBut when you ask a statistician why he doesn’t just run the numbers and test\nthe hypothesis, he points out that defining the low-to-high original move and\nthen defining the stopping point of a retracement is a computational night-\nmare. No matter what definitions he gives his software, another analyst is\nsure to want to refine them in some other way. You'll see studies, for exam-\nple, showing that the actual percentage change of many retracements isn’t\nprecisely 50 percent, but rather in a range of 45 to 55 percent. Should you\naccept a minor retracement of 45 percent but not a major one that correctly\npredicts a trend resumption at 44 percent?\n\nA critical point about the 50 percent retracement rule is that you may think\nyou want to exit to protect your profit at the 50 percent level. If you bought\nthe security at $10 and it rose to $30, but has now fallen to $20, shown in\nFigure 2-3, you want to sell at $20 to hang on to the gain you have left. But if\nthe 50 percent retracement rule works this time, you would be getting out\nexactly when you should by buying more (adding to your position), because a\nresumption of the trend at the $20 level almost certainly means that the price\nwill now go higher than the highest high so far, $30.\n\nA 100 percent retracement, a price that goes from $10 to $30 and back to $10,\nwill often form a double bottom, a bullish formation. When the price peaks\ntwice at the same level, you have a double top, a bearish formation. (See\nChapter 9 for more details on these formations.)\n\n50% RETRACEMENT\nBUY HERE\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

This theory says that a retracement is most\nlikely to stop at one of a series of numbers, with an emphasis on 38 percent\nor 62 percent of the original move. Where does this come from?\n\nA 13th-century Italian mathematician named Fibonacci discovered a self-\nreplicating sequence of numbers with curious properties. It starts with 1, 1,\n2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on to infinity. The sum of two adjacent\nnumbers in the sequence forms the next higher number in the sequence.\nMost important, the ratio of any two consecutive numbers approximates\n1.618 or its inverse, 0.618 (after the first few numbers).\n\nNature offers many examples of these ratios: daisy petals, ferns, sunflowers,\nseashells, hurricanes, whirlpools, and atomic particles in a bubble chamber.\nAnd many of man’s works purportedly embody the Fibonacci ratios as well:\nthe pyramids in Egypt, the Parthenon in Greece, and Cézanne’s choice of\ncanvas shape, although some mathematicians dispute some or all of these.\n\nOf course, critics point out that many other events in nature, architecture, and\nhuman behavior follow a sequence of 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. The number 11 can be\nconsidered magic, not to mention pi (3.14159), used to calculate the circumference\nof a circle. Prime numbers, which are numbers divisible only by themselves and\none (3, 5, 7, 11, 17, and so on), are important numbers. In fact, many other self-\nreplicating number sequences exist. In short, scientists say that to attribute human\nbehavior to any single number sequence is ludicrous, or at least not plausible.\n\nA trader named Ralph Nelson Elliott believed that man’s behavior, including\nhis behavior when trading in the stock market, revealed similar character-\nistics as the Fibonacci sequence and could therefore be charted to predict\nfuture behavior. Elliott observed that securities prices appear in a wave-\n\nlike form on charts, hence the name of his forecasting method, Elliott Wave.\nElliott wrote that the Fibonacci sequence provides the mathematical under-\npinnings of the wave principle. Elliott Wave adherents expanded Elliott’s use\nof the Fibonacci sequence and often use Fibonacci levels, with special atten-\ntion to 38 percent and 62 percent (but also including 23.6 percent, 50 percent,\nand 100 percent of the high-low span), to predict the extent of retracements.\nNote that technically, 50 percent isn’t a Fibonacci number. It’s customary to\ninclude it, though, possibly because of Gann’s influence.\n\nTo make life difficult, some traders who like the Fibonacci sequence aren’t\nstrict adherents of the Elliot Wave principle and some Elliot Wave traders\ndon’t necessarily believe that price moves will stick to Fibonacci numbers.\nSee the sidebar “The Elliot Wave principle” in this chapter for more about the\nElliott Wave, which goes far beyond the subject of retracements.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Part I: Defining Technical Analysis\n\nThe Elliott Wave principle\n\nThe wave idea became popular in part because\none of its proponents, Robert Prechter, called\nfor a massive bull market in 1982 that did materi-\nalize — and then he called the top, just ahead of\nthe 1987 Crash. That certainly got the market's\nattention! And prices do seem to move in waves\non many charts.\n\nThe basic idea is that all price movements have\ntwo segments: impulse waves and corrective\nwaves. The impulse wave is the way the crowd\nwants to take the price in a trend. Considering\nthat the right way to look at price develop-\nments is through the lens of crowd psychology,\nimpulse is an excellent choice of words. Each\nimpulse wave has five parts: three waves that\ngo in the trend direction, alternating with two\nthat go in the opposite direction.\n\nIna correction, each corrective wave has three\nparts: two that go against the main trend and\none that goes with it. If a bull market reaches\na new high in five waves instead of three\nand also goes down in five waves instead of\nthree, you're witnessing the beginning of a\nmajor bear market\n\nYou will often see three clear waves up,\nalthough sometimes a move has more upwaves\nthan three, as in Figure 2-3. The three-waves\nrule is only the model of how markets move, not\na rigid orthodoxy.\n\nElliot Wave practitioners are the first to admit\nthat calling corrective waves is tricky, much\nharder than seeing impulse waves. Experienced\npractitioners advise against straining to make a\ncorrection “fit” the Elliott Wave model. A cor-\nrection often just keeps on going, too, where-\nupon itisn't a correction but a true reversal and\nthus a new trend in the opposite direction.\n\nCounting waves can be an elaborate and time-\nconsuming process, and miscounting as prices\nevolve can result in losses and having to start\nall over again. If the wave idea appeals to you,\nbe prepared to devote a lot of time to it. If you\nchoose not to count waves, you can still benefit\nfrom the observation that trends start with an\nimpulse wave that then retraces in the oppo-\nsite direction before the trend resumes. “Buy\non the dip” isn't bad advice when you are sure\nthat you have a trend.\n\nSeeing too many retracements\n\nFans of the Fibonacci sequence assert that the 38 percent and 62 percent\nretracement levels occur more often than chance would allow, although I\nhave never seen statistical proof. (Perhaps because any statistical studies\nwould degenerate into squabbling over measurement criteria.)\n\nSome traders embrace Gann’s ideas, some embrace the Elliott Wave, some\nembrace Fibonacci numbers, and some embrace them all. If you were to put\nthe main Gann retracement numbers (12.5, 25, 50, and 75 percent) and the\nmain Fibonacci retracement numbers (23.5 percent, 38 percent, and 62 per-\ncent) on the same chart of a trend, you’d have so many lines that the next\nretracement would be bound to hit one of them or a level near one of them.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

By definition, all math is science. If you’re\ngoing to follow an advisor, put your faith in a consistently winning track\nrecord rather than in claims of an inside track to universal truth.\n\nLike all technical methods, applying Gann and Elliott Wave ideas is an art,\nand constant revision is necessary as prices evolve. Statisticians scoff at\nmagic numbers, but in any particular market or security, if a majority of trad-\ners believe that a retracement will stop at 38 percent, 50 percent, or 62 per-\ncent after a peak, they can and do make it come about.\n\nThe sensible approach to Gann and Fibonacci retracement ideas is to be aware\nof their influence over some traders.

When just about every trader is either bullish or bearish, you need to\nstop following the crowd.

Volume directly represents the extent\n\nof trader participation and is a powerful indicator in its raw state, before you\neven manipulate the data to derive an indicator.\n\nThe word indicator refers to a statistic comprised of data about the price or\nvolume of a security that has been reorganized or rearranged to provide ana-\nlytical insight. You can use just about any market data that takes your fancy to\ncreate an indicator. Some indicators pertain to the entire market, like the day-\nto-day change in the volume on the New York Stock Exchange, and some indi-\ncators relate to specific securities, like IBM stock.

You need\nto have a basic understanding of probability to accept some of the inherent\nlimitations of technical analysis and also to avoid getting cheated by sellers\nof technical programs.\n\nDefining Market Sentiment\n\nIn technical analysis, sentiment comes in only two flavors — bullish (the\nprice is going up) or bearish (the price is going down). At any moment in\ntime, a bullish crowd can take a price upward, or a bearish crowd can take\nit downward. When the balance of sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish\n(or vice versa), a pivot point emerges. A pivot point is the point (or a region)\nwhere an up move ends and a down move begins (or the other way around).\nAt the pivot point, the crowd itself realizes that it has gone to an extreme,\nand it reacts by heading in the opposite direction.\n\nAs far back as the early 1900s, traders observed that if they were patient and\nwaited for a pivot point to develop, they could trade at the right psychologi-\ncal time — just as the crowd is beginning a new move. When the crowd is\nreaching an emotional extreme, the crowd is usually moving in the wrong\ndirection. A reversal point is impending. You should do the opposite of what\nthe crowd is doing, or at least get ready to.\n\nGetting the Low-Down on Volume\n\nPas\n\nYou are more confident that a price move has staying power if you know that\nmany traders are involved in a price move and not just one or two.\n\nVolume is the term for the number of shares or contracts of a security traded\nin a period. Volume is the most powerful confirming indicator of a price\nmove, and confirmation is a key concept in technical analysis. (See Chapter 16\nfor more on the confirmation concept.) When you look at price changes,\n\nyou imagine buyers demanding more of the security at ever-higher prices\n\nor sellers offering a greater supply at ever-lower prices, which you can read\nabout in Chapters 6, 7, and 8. But a price can move on a single large purchase\nor sale, especially if the market happens not to have many participants at\nthat exact moment, a condition named illiquidity. (See Chapter 6 for a more-\ndetailed description of liquidity.)\n\nIn technical trading, you use volume to measure the extent of trader par-\nticipation. When a price rise is accompanied by rising volume, you have\nconfirmation that the direction is associated with participation. You’re no\nlonger imagining demand as being behind the price rise, as when you perform\nbar analysis (see Chapter 6). Instead, you have outright, direct evidence of\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Similarly, if you see a price fall by a large amount, but the change\nisn’t accompanied by a change in volume, you can deduce that the price\nchange was an aberration. Some trader made a mistake.\n\nVolume tells us only the number of shares or contracts traded, not the\nnumber of participants. Obviously you can get a jump in volume that is due\nto only a handful of participants, and then you will be drawing the wrong\ninference from high volume.\n\nIn this section, you can turn up your use of volume in technical analysis by\nconsidering a few top-drawer indicators. These indicators tend to be among\nthe most reliable in technical analysis.\n\nLeading the way with spikes\n\nVolume sometimes leads price. The most obvious situations are when\nvolume spikes. A spike is a volume number that is double or more the size\n\nof volume on the preceding days. Say volume has been running at 100,000\nshares per day for several days or weeks and suddenly it explodes to 500,000\nshares. If the price had been in a downtrend, this wild increase in volume\nmeans that the crowd is throwing in the towel and exiting en masse.\n\nWhen everyone has jumped off the bandwagon, get ready to jump back on.\nNobody’s left to propel the price lower. Conversely, the same advice is usu-\nally correct when you see a volume spike as the price is making new highs.\nThe underlying principle is the same — the crowd has exhausted its supply of\ncash. Think about taking profit if you own the security. If you’re considering\nanew position in a rising security that just had a volume spike, think again.\nLook at other indicators. Try to understand why so many people suddenly\njumped on the bandwagon — does fresh news justify the increase in demand\nfor the security, or is it just animal spirits?\n\nA volume spike is one of the occasions when fundamental information is\ncomplementary to a technical observation. Beware a price making new highs\ncoupled with a volume spike when there is no fresh news or fundamental\ninformation that attracted new buyers. Chances are that the top is in. If the\nsecurity has new, legitimately exciting news and you can reasonably deduce\nthat it attracted new buyers, you have a nontechnical reason to ignore the\nusual spike interpretation.\n\nTracking on-balance volume\n\nOn-balance volume (OBV) is a single number representing cumulative volume.\nA market technician named Joe Granville devised the OBV indicator to display\nvolume adjusted as follows: To calculate OBV, you add volume on days that\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Follow along:\n\nThe down move: In the section of Figure 3-1 marked by the ellipse,\nnotice how the price down move, already in progress, is suddenly\naccompanied by a big rise in volume. The increase in volume starts the\nday before the downward gap. I describe gaps in Chapter 7, but take my\nword for it: A falling price punctuated by a downward gap is a message\nthat the price is going to fall farther. The OBV indicator forecasts the\nimpending bottom, falling ahead of the volume spike and the gap.\n\nIf you own the stock and see the OBV indicator start to decline and\n\nthen you see spiky volume (like the area in the ellipse), you should sell.\nHolding on after the downward gap is to court a fat loss. In fact, the loss\nfrom the open on the gap-down day in Figure 3-1 to the close on the day\nof the lowest low is $7.22. If you had sold the stock on the very day that\nvolume spiked, the day before the gap, you would have saved another\n$4.75, for a total of $11.97.\n\nFigure 3-1 shows that the stock did come back this time and put in\nhigher highs a few months later. But you don’t know that in advance. To\nhold on through the falling-price period would be to give up the chance\nto save as much as $11.97 in cash.\n\nThe up move: OBV reaches its lowest levels about two weeks before\nPivot Day 1, which features the lowest low in the series of lower lows,\nbut a higher closing price and a gap upward the following day. (To\nrefresh your understanding of the price bar components, see Chapter 6.)\nNotice on Figure 3-1 that OBV is already rising while the price is still\nfalling, a divergence that is a critical clue to an impending change in the\ndirection of the price.\n\nThe divergence of price and an indicator that normally move in tandem is a\nwake-up call. A change in volume often predicts a change in price. The indica-\ntor is telling you something you can’t see with the naked eye — prices were\nputting in new lows but not consistently closing lower than the day before.\nBuying and selling pressure, or supply and demand, was reaching a balance.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

They are alert to the moment when the\ncrowd suddenly realizes that it has taken a price too far — and reacts vio-\nlently in the other direction. For example, down around the price lows in IBM\nstock in Figure 3-1, somebody had to be buying in order for the stock to close\nat higher levels than the day before (which is what changed the OBV indica-\ntor).

This message to the crowd is to buy, and they do, leading to Pivot\nDay 2 on Figure 3-1.

    "text": "46\nPart I: Defining Technical Analysis \nTruth to tell, though, no indicator works all the time, and this one doesn’t, \neither. The OBV indicator didn’t forecast Pivot Day 2 on Figure 3-1, although \nit did fall right afterward. Therefore, you’d have to say it was not leading this \ntime, but rather coincidental. Even OBV inventor Granville famously missed \na major bull market that started in 1982, and then persisted in saying it was \na false bull for the next 14 years. However, OBV correctly predicted the \ncrash of October, 1987 — in August, two months early. So you can see that \nGranville’s personal woes with forecasting do not detract from the usefulness \nof his indicator, even if it can be tricky to apply.\nRefining volume indicators\nAs noted in the section “Tracking on-balance volume” earlier in the chapter, \nthe OBV indicator attributes all the day’s volume to buying. This is not realis-\ntic. It makes more sense to attribute only a portion of the volume to the price \nrise, rather than the whole kit and caboodle.\nA technical analyst named Marc Chaikin figured that a more representative \namount would be the percentage equivalent of the price that is above the \nmidpoint of the day. You calculate a midpoint as the high of the day plus the \nlow of the day divided by two. Chaikin’s version of accumulation and distri-\nbution is more refined than OBV.\nIf a security closes above its daily midpoint, bullish sentiment ruled. The \nclose over the midpoint defines accumulation, referring to buyers being will-\ning to pay higher prices to get sellers to part with the security. The closer the \nclosing price is to the high, the more bullish it was. If the price closed right \nat the high, then you say that 100 percent of the volume can be attributed to \nbullish sentiment.\nConversely, distribution is the term for sellers willing to accept lower prices \nin order to induce buyers to buy. Lower prices imply bearish sentiment. \nDistribution is calculated the same way as accumulation — a close below the \nprice midpoint means distribution. The closer the closing price is to the low, \nthe more distribution existed. If the close is exactly at the midpoint, then the \nindicator has the same value as yesterday — and you have no reason to add \nor subtract volume from the running total.\nThinking Outside the Chart\nYou may have the inside scoop on the best stock ever, but if the entire \nmarket has a case of the collywobbles, your best-ever stock is likely to fall, \ntoo. Conversely, when the market is in a manic phase, even the worst of \nstocks gets a boost (hence the old saying, “A rising tide lifts all boats”). This \nwww.it-ebooks.info",

All these institutions have latitude about how\nmuch money to keep in cash. In a mania, they get more fully invested, and in\na panic, they pull funds out of the market and into cash.\n\nNobody knows for sure, but some percentage of any security’s price move is\nattributable to changes in the market environment. Factors include not only\nthe index to which it belongs, but also its size (large-cap or small-cap, for\nexample) and sector (biotech, high-tech, no-tech). A guess is that about 25\npercent of a price move in any single issue should be considered a function of\nwhat is going on in its index (or other benchmark to which the issue belongs).\n\nTo get a handle on possible market effects on your specific security, you want\nto measure overall market sentiment. You do this by looking at market statis-\ntics. Strictly speaking, market statistics are not fechnical analysis, which is the\nstudy of how specific prices behave. Nevertheless, sentiment measures can be\nhelpful as a supplement and complement to your decision making.\n\nIn this section, you can combat the ups and downs of the market by gaining\nadditional market tools to add to your chart tool belt. You are still looking for\nthe supply-and-demand dynamics, just not for your own specific security.\n\nSampling information about sentiment\n\nMost sentiment indicators look outside the price dynamics of a particular\nsecurity or index of securities for information about whether the trading\ncrowd is humming along with expectations of normalcy or is willing to jump\nship. In technical trading, the key principle is to study what people do (price\nand volume), not what they say. You can do just that by following the sugges-\ntions in this section.\n\nMonitoring investors: The Bull/Bear Ratio\n\nKey reversals come when the majority of advisors (60 percent or more)\n\nare bullish or bearish. In other words, when everyone recognizes the trend\nbandwagon and has hopped on board, it’s over. Investors Intelligence Service\n(started over 60 years ago) measures the balance of bullish sentiment against\nbearish sentiment (called the Bull/Bear Ratio) and claims an excellent track\nrecord in predicting turning points.\n\nNote that other services have sprung up to measure bull and bear sentiment\nin general, in specialized sectors, and in mutual funds. You can find the Bull/\nBear Ratio and other indicators on hundreds of Web sites and in business\nnewspapers. To get a specific Bull/Bear Ratio from a specific vendor the\nminute it’s published, you have to pay a subscription fee.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You can \ntrack the breadth indicators to get a feel for market sentiment.\nBreadth indicators include\n \n✓ Ratio of advancing to declining issues: This indicator measures the \nmood of the market. Stocks that are reaching a higher price today than \nyesterday are called advancing issues. Stocks that are reaching lower \nprices are called declining issues. When advancers outnumber decliners, \nmoney is flowing into the market. Bulls are beating bears. Sentiment is \nfavorable. When the rally starts getting tired, the number of advancing \nissues declines while the number of falling issues rises.\n \n If you subtract declining issues from advancing ones, you get the \nadvance/decline line. In the same vein, if you divide advancing issues by \ndeclining issues, you get the advance/decline ratio, abbreviated A/D.\n \n✓ Difference between issues making new highs and new lows: The logic \nis the same as in the advance/decline indicator. If more stocks in an \nindex are closing at higher prices than the period before, bullishness \nis on the rise. When a higher number are putting in new lows, supply is \noverwhelming demand and the mood must be bearish.\nFollowing the betting: Options\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is the venue for options trad-\ning in equity indices like the S&P and NASDAQ indices. The CBOE publishes \nthe ratio of puts to calls. Here’s what you need to know about puts and calls \nwhen gathering info about sentiment:\n \n✓ Put: This term refers to the right to sell at a set price in the future. \nTraders who buy puts are bears (pessimists) who think the index won’t \nreach their set price.\n \n✓ Call: A call is the right to buy at a set price in the future. Traders who \nbuy calls are bulls (optimists) who think they’ll profit when the market \nrises to and beyond their set price.\nAccordingly, the put/call ratio is an indicator of whether sentiment is bear-\nish or bullish. A high put/call ratio means bears are winning. Recognize that \nan extreme of emotion like this is usually wrong, and marks a turning point. \nYou should start planning to do the opposite. The same line of thinking holds \ntrue for a low put/call ratio: When emotions are running strongly optimistic, \nwatch out for an opportunity to take advantage of a change.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "49\n\nChapter 3: Going with the Flow: Market Sentiment\n\nViewing volatility: The VIX\n\nThe volatility index (VIX) is among the most popular breadth indicators\ntoday. Theoretically, you can create a volatility index for any security in\nwhich options are traded, although it takes computational expertise. Its cal-\nculation is too complicated to get into here, but for information about volatil-\nity, see Chapter 14. For your purposes, know that when the crowd is jumpy\nand nervous, it projects that anxiety into the future and assumes that prices\nwill be abnormal.\n\nIn other words, the crowd believes volatility will be high. When the price of\nVIX is high, options traders have been buying puts and selling calls on the\nindex — they’re bearish and think the market may fall. (For more on puts and\ncalls, check out the section “Following the betting: Options,” earlier in this\nchapter.) In actuality, what they really think is that the risk of a fall is high\nand worth spending some insurance money on. When VIX is low, the market\nis relaxed and confident — overly confident.\n\nYou can use VIX as a contrary indicator. When VIX is either abnormally high\nor abnormally low, you know it’s getting to the right time to trade against the\n\ncrowd. Start watching for reversal points in your own stable of securities. A\nhigh VIX value means exactly the opposite of what it seems to mean — the\n\nbottom isn’t coming, it’s already in! If VIX is low, the crowd is girding its loins\nfor a big move. When VIX is low, traders are complacent. They’re projecting\nthe same price levels, or nearly the same levels, into the immediate future\nwith little variation and therefore little risk.\n\nContrarians and cranks\n\nA contrarian is someone who has a fundamen-\ntal reason for thinking that a security is mis-\npriced. In equities, one such reason could be\ninsider info that an out-of-favor pharmaceuti-\ncal company has secretly discovered the cure\nfor some important disease and its price will\nshoot the moon on the announcement. In finan-\ncial futures (stock indices, bonds, and curren-\ncies), a fundamental reason to judge a security\nmispriced may be a forecast of a central bank\ninterest rate change that nobody else can see\ncoming. A true contrarian is quite rare, although\nlots of people fancy themselves contrarians\nwhen they're just cranks. When a contrarian\nis right, he becomes a zillionaire and is called\neccentric. When he is wrong, he stays poor and\nis called a crackpot.\n\nIn contrast, technical trading is by its very\nnature noncontrarian. You want to go with the\ncrowd, not against it (most of the time). To iden-\ntify when the crowd has gone too far isn’t con-\ntrarian in the proper sense of the term. When\nyou figure out that a pivot point is impending,\nyou're a crowd leader. Confusion about the\nmeaning of the word contrarian arises because\nsome followers of sentiment indicators use it\nwhen talking about turning points predicted\nby indicator extremes. To recognize that at the\ntop of a rally everyone is fully invested and no\nbuyers are left is called contrarian logic. But to\nsay that the crowd is wrong isn't contrarian —\nit's simply understanding crowd dynamics. A\ntrue contrarian has a fundamental reason to say\nthat the crowd is wrong.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The prices of agricultural commodities rise and fall with\nthe seasons. Seasonality is the term used for the natural rise and fall of prices\naccording to the time of year.\n\nOddly — very oddly — equities and financial futures exhibit a similar effect:\nThey change according to the time of year. The changes are regular and con-\nsistent enough to warrant your attention.\n\nDefining seasonality and calendar effects\n\nSeasonality used to be a word applied to agricultural prices, and calendar\neffects was a word applied to equities. Today they’re used interchangeably.\nYou can discover the seasonality characteristics of any given stock by using\nseasonality trackers on various Web sites, including the best-known seasonal-\nity tracker, Thomson Financial. Their Web site allows you to see a chart of\nany stock with its associated average returns by month, starting in 1986. You\ncan also see a table of the months in which the stock rose or fell over the\nyears.\n\nYou have probably heard the adage, “Sell in May and go away.” This advice\ncomes from work on calendar effects by Yale and Jeffrey Hirsch, who tested\nthe correlation of stock indices with the time of year in their annual Stock\nTrader’s Almanac. The sell in May rule is called the best six months rule.\n\nHirsch discovered that nearly all the gains in the S&P 500 are made between\nNovember | and April 30. This rule isn’t true without exception, but it’s true for\nmost years since 1950. When April 30 rolls around, you sell all your stocks and\nput the money in U.S. government Treasuries. Come November 1, you reenter\nthe stock market. If you’d followed this rule every year since 1950 and also\nmodified the exact timing a little by applying the moving average convergence-\ndivergence indicator (check out MACD in Chapter 12), a starting capital stake\nof $10,000 in 1952 would have ballooned to $1,472,790 by 2009. On average, you\nwould've been invested only six and a half months each year — and remember,\nwhen you're not in the market, you’re not taking market risk.\n\nOther calendar effects include\nJanuary Barometer: When the S&P 500 is up in January, it'll close the\n\nyear higher than it opened. Since 1950, this rule has an accuracy reading\nof 90 percent.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In fact, the only big down year in the\nthird year of a presidential term was 1931.\n\nPresidential Election Cycle: Wars, recessions, and bear markets tend\nto start in the first two years, while prosperity and bull markets tend to\nhappen in the second two years. Since 1833, the last two years of a presi-\ndent’s term produced a cumulative net gain in the Dow of 718.5 percent,\nwhile the first two years produced 262.1 percent.\n\nHirsch and others have discovered many other calendar effects. Hirsch’s\nannual Stock Traders Almanac publishes the probability of any of the three\nmajor indices (Dow, S&P 500, and NASDAQ) rising or falling on any day of\nthe year. The almanac bases this information on what has happened in those\nindexes on those dates since January 1953.\n\nUsing seasonality and calendar effects\n\nPaying attention to calendar effects can help improve your market timing.\nWhen your're sitting down to make a trading or investment decision, you can\navoid a costly mistake by consulting the calendar not only for the specific\nsecurity, but also for the index to which it belongs.\n\nCalendar effects are more than a curiosity, although a security on a wild rally\nisn’t going to stop solely because it’s May 1. But because so many traders\nand money managers know about calendar effects, they are to some degree a\nself-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nBe aware that statisticians don’t all agree on exactly how to measure seasonal-\nity effects. Seasonality statisticians quarrel with one another about matters\nbig and small. If you have a talent for statistics and for judging among the\navailable techniques, you can easily benefit by consulting seasonality studies\nor conducting your own.\n\nGlindsiding the Crowd\n\nYou may find it comforting to think that you can find regularity and orderli-\nness in charts, using the technical methods that take up most of this book,\nor the sentiment statistics pertaining to the market at large described in this\nchapter.

When the move is small, the mini-mania or\nmini-panic is forecastable and tradeable. But sometimes the market delivers\na mania and an ensuing panic that are huge and all but define an era. Think of\nthe Roaring 1920s and the crash of 1929, which took over 20 years to recover.\nThis section gives you some comfort and guidance if you are unlucky enough\nto be fully invested when a panic arises.\n\nConsidering historic key reversals\n\nAn enduring mystery of market history is that big, key reversal points seem\nto come out of the blue. Seldom can you find a specific event that triggers\n\na rally taking off or that can be named as the cause of a bubble bursting.\nThink back to the collapse of the United States equity markets in March 2000.\nExactly what caused that fall? Experts can name a dozen contributing factors,\nbut no one can put a finger on a single, defining factor. Technical indicators\nwere very useful to exit not long after the bubble burst, but to be honest,\n\nthis was a function of the risk management principles embedded in technical\nanalysis far more than forecasting capability.\n\nMany people give up on technical analysis at this point, but don’t make the\nsame mistake! You can trust your indicators up to a certain extent, but your\noverall survival as a trader depends on risk management, which I talk about\n\nin Chapter 5, and not on indicators themselves. Risk management is the only\nsolution to giant random market effects. In the meanwhile, I have a useful way\nto think about randomness so that it won’t overwhelm you. Check out the sec-\ntion “Enduring randomness” in this chapter for useful tips.\n\nTake note that opinion is divided on whether historic key reversals or even\nall key reversals occur randomly. One camp says that news causes prices\n\nto change, and nobody can forecast the news. News is random. Therefore,\nprices must be random, too. But the other side notes that if prices were\nrandom, you wouldn’t be able to see trends on a chart — and you clearly can.\nNo amount of fancy theorizing can overcome the evidence of your eyes. If\nprices were random, prices wouldn’t trend. But unmistakably, they do.\n\nAny particular price may be random, but not every price can be random, or\ntraders wouldn't be able to make a bid and an offer on the next price. The\nmarket would collapse — no trading would occur. Instead, traders remember\npreceding prices and put the current price into the context of those past\nprices. From past prices, you form an expectation of the future price. You\nwill, of course, see inexplicable prices and it’s fair to call them random.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But as a practi-\ncal matter, if you follow your risk management principles, you don’t need an \nanswer to this question.\nEnduring randomness\nTechnical traders acknowledge that random events can and do cause the \noccasional wild price departure from the norm, but the acknowledgement \ndoesn’t alter the expectation that prices will behave normally. For example, \nyou sometimes see a price spike so big that you don’t know how to interpret \nit (as you can see in Chapter 7). Often you never find out why such a bizarre \nprice occurred.\nA price spike is the equivalent of a tornado in weather forecasting. You know \nthe conditions that cause tornadoes — you just don’t know exactly when an \nactual tornado will develop.\nAlthough nature may not be able to deliver a tornado in Alaska in January, \nthe equivalent does happen in markets. Sudden cataclysmic events aren’t as \nrare as you may imagine. Who would have thought that the S&P 500 could \nfall more than 20 percent in a single day? Most market observers used to say \nit was impossible. But that’s exactly what happened on Black Monday, 1987. \nMost market tornadoes, like Black Monday, give plenty of technical warnings \nahead of time. The problem is that traders often have those same warnings \nand don’t get a Black Monday. This is an inconvenient fact of life that you \nhave to accept.\nSpikes are both a problem and an opportunity. If you know why a spike is \noccurring because you are well informed about world events and market \nchatter in response to the world events, you may chose to ride it out. But to \nexit on fear of randomness is okay, too. You take no risk when you are out of \nthe market. Nowhere is it written that you must have a position in the market \nat all times.\nRemembering the last price\nMarket panics and crashes on the scale of 1929, 1987, and 2000 are historic \nevents outside the purview of the crowd’s normal trading process. In normal \ntrading, you can assume that a wildly erratic price has a low probability of \noccurring. But you can’t attach a specific probability statistic to an event of \nhistoric proportions — partly because those events are so rare.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But in markets, a low-probability event \ndoes change the odds for the next period analysis because traders remember.\nWhen you are performing technical analysis on your securities, you count on \ntraders to remember the last prices and to form their trading plans on those \nprices. The next price is normally dependent on preceding prices, and most \ntechnical analysis programs allow you to project out a trendline (like a linear \nregression line, for example).\nBut one or two really big abnormal prices can sometimes upset the apple \ncart and determining which way the crowd will jump is sometimes just a \ncoin toss. This analogy raises the issue of the reliability of indicators, which \nI describe in Chapter 4. They’re essentially forecasting tools that depend on \npast behaviors to predict future behaviors, but they often fail near really big \nkey reversals. Technical analysis is not science, as its inability to capture \nhistoric key reversals ahead of time demonstrates. In other words, having the \nbest technical tools on the planet will not save you from a market tornado.\nThinking Scientifically\nEven the best indicator fails to work all the time. In fact, some of the best \nindicators work less than 50 percent of the time, and that’s when conditions \nare normal! Critics use this awful statistic to say that technical analysis is a \nwaste of time. This harsh opinion results from a failure to appreciate the ben-\nefits of risk management embedded in the technical trading style.\nYou may think that it’s overkill to discuss scientific method, but I can practi-\ncally guarantee that this section will have a big payoff for you. That’s because \nyou’re sure to see enticing advertisements for software or trading programs \nthat are “scientific” and “objective.” Well, all math is “scientific” and “objec-\ntive” — but that doesn’t mean you can use it to make money, and it certainly \ndoesn’t mean that using it will help you escape the next market tornado.\nConditions and contingencies\nWhen you hear someone say, “Blue Widget has a 75 percent chance of rising,” \nyou can assume that three out of the last four times the technical method was \napplied, the security rose. The unspoken assumption is that conditions didn’t \nchange. But the market is not a laboratory. Of course conditions changed!\nYour forecast needs to be qualified because of the thousands of factors that \nmay come along and influence the price.

You know what a contingency is — like hitting every streetlight red on\nthe way to the train station to catch the 6:09. If you hit the average number\nof red lights, you can make it on time to catch the train. If they’re all red and\nyou also have to slow down for construction, you miss your train.\n\nWhen you hear a market maven predicting a price change with a 75 percent\nprobability, chances are he’s talking through his hat. He may have failed to\nincorporate all the reasonable contingencies, or he may have attributed too\nsmall a probability to any of them (or to all of them). Read financial history,\nand you find the ground littered with the corpses of traders who failed to\ninclude a key contingency in their calculations.\n\nMost technical traders hate to attach a probability to a particular outcome,\nlike “Blue Widget has a 75 percent change of rising.” Reluctance to apply the\nterm probability is due to a realistic assessment of the contingencies. In sta-\ntistics, when you want to calculate the probability of two events happening\nsimultaneously (called joint probability), you multiply their probabilities. If\nyou have two remotely possible contingencies, each with a probability of 10\npercent, the chances of both happening simultaneously is 10 percent times\n10 percent, or | percent.\n\nTo calculate the effect of a 10 percent probability contingency on your trade,\nyou take the reciprocal of the probability, or 90 percent, as the amount to\nmodify the 75 percent. In arithmetic notation, it looks like this:\n\n75 percent times 90 percent = 67.50 percent\n\nGood grief — introducing one contingency reduced the probability of your out-\ncome from 75 percent to 67.5 percent. It gets worse. If you have four contingen-\ncies and you attribute a 10 percent chance to each of them, the same process\n\nreduces your 75 percent odds to a mere 49.21 percent, which is less than 50-50.\n\nJoint probabilities really stink, don’t they? No wonder technical traders hate\nto declare a forecast! The more contingencies you admit, the lower the prob-\nability of the outcome.\n\nSample size\n\nStatisticians say you need a minimum of 30 cases before you can say anything\nvalid about the probability of history repeating itself. Scientists who do really\nserious science, like missiles and moon shots, demand a minimum of 200\ncases. In setting up the Blue Widget example in the preceding section, I attrib-\nuted a 75 percent chance of the price rising because three out of the last four\ntimes that conditions looked the same, that’s what happened. But a sample\nsize of four instances is hardly sufficient.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The answer is that you’re using a technical analysis \nmethod that works across a wide range of securities and time frames, even if \nyou don’t have enough cases in this specific security.\nFor example, when you have a support line (which I describe in Chapter 10) \nand your price breaks it to the downside, that’s a sell signal. Over the past \n100 years, technical analysts have used the break of a support line hundreds \nof thousands of times, maybe millions, and it worked. Using this method was \nthe correct trading decision in the majority of a very large number of cases. \nStill, choosing to use the break of a support line as a signal doesn’t work \nevery time. A support line break is an example of a technical forecast that has \na high probability in the context of many different contingencies and over \nmany sets of conditions.\nOther techniques are less reliable. You may think it would be wonderful to \nhave a list of techniques with their reliability quotient, which is a ranking of \nhow often they’re right. Some writers and software vendors claim that their \ntechniques are “over 75 percent correct.” This lofty proclamation is hardly \never true.

But indicators don’t always work, and I| explain\nwhy in this chapter. To overcome the unreliability of indicators, a money\nmanagement plan is necessary, which I cover in Chapter 5.\n\nBER Trading is about money, and money arouses hot emotions. To speak of trad-\nss ing as involving only greed and fear, though, as most commentators do, is to\nshortchange the range of emotion in trading. Trading is also about personal\nsuccess and failure.

The chief tool to squelch emotion is the indicator.\n\nIntroducing Indicators\n\nBER An indicator is a calculation that you put on a chart to identify chart events,\nss chiefly whether the price is trending, the degree of trendedness, and whether\na trend turning point is being reached.

You can clas-\nsify your indicators easily, because they come in two varieties:\n\n Judgment-based indicators: This group includes visual pattern-\nrecognition methods such as bar, line, and pattern analysis, as well as\ncandlesticks (see Chapters 6 through 10). These indicators can be time\nconsuming to master and to use. They’re also hard to translate into\nsoftware formulations so that you can backtest them to see how they\nwould’ve worked over the price history of your security.\n\n Math-based indicators: The math group includes moving averages,\nregression, momentum, and other types of calculations (see Chapters 10\nthrough 15). Expressing chart events in mathematical terms allows you\nto backtest the event over historical data to discover how well it pre-\ndicts the next price action.\n\nYou may prefer to jump straight to math-based indicators because they’re\nfaster, cleaner, and “scientific.” But math-based indicators do the same job as\njudgment indicators — they display price data in a specific format to assist\nyou in making a trading decision. Just because they’re based on math doesn’t\nmean that they aren’t subjective. You determine the specifications of math-\nbased indicators in the first place (such as how many days are in a moving\naverage). Visual recognition and math-based techniques are equally valid and\nuseful. Some traders use only visual-recognition techniques, some use only\nmath-based indicators, and some use both.\n\nIf math isn’t your cup of tea, don’t worry. The math involved in most technical\nanalysis isn’t all that difficult (except up in the stratosphere of advanced tech-\nnical analysis). You can apply math-based techniques without understanding\nthe math behind them as long as you understand the crowd behavior the indi-\ncator is identifying and how to apply the indicator. Think of it as knowing how\nto drive a car without being able to build a carburetor.\n\nUnderstanding what indicators identify\n\nIn Chapters 1| and 2,1 point out that securities prices are sometimes frend-\ning — they have a strong directional bias — and that trends are punctuated\nby retracements, or small moves in the opposite direction before the trend\nresumes. At other times, prices go sideways, called range-trading, which can\nbe considered a trend in its own right. Finally, trends end, and after they end,\nthey may reverse to the opposite direction. So indicators identify five condi-\ntions; note that in this list, ] put some suggestions next to each condition, but\nsomeone else could name other, equally valid, indicators:\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Technical \ntraders argue the merits and drawbacks of indicators in each situation, and \nif you ask ten technical traders to list their top indicator for each task, you’ll \nget ten entirely different lists. To a certain extent, the indicator you choose \nfor each task depends on the security and also on the analytical time frame.\nChoosing your trading style\nUnless you’re trading setups, which I describe in Chapter 16, the trend is \nalways the focus. In a perfect world, you first determine whether your secu-\nrity is trending or range-trading sideways, and then you apply the appropri-\nate indicator. In practice, you can’t always classify price moves as trending or \nnot trending in a neat and tidy way. Besides, prices usually have an identifi-\nable range, whether they’re trending or not. In addition, retracements always \ncreate doubt — you find yourself wondering, “Is it a momentary correction or \na reversal?”\nGenerally, traders tend to have one of the following two personal trading \nstyles and the style dictates the holding period:\n \n✓ Trend-followers: Traders who like to identify trends may wait out \nretracements and sideways range-trading situations until they resolve \nback into a trend. Other trend followers use information from momen-\ntum indicators to modify their positions, for instance by taking some \nprofit when the security becomes overbought or oversold even though \nthe trend is just pausing. They expect it to continue. (See Chapter 2 for \na definition of overbought and oversold and Chapter 13 for overbought \nand oversold indicators.) Figure 4-1 illustrates a trend, complete with \nminor retracements, and shows how a trend-following trader makes \ndecisions.\n \n✓ Swing traders: These folks operate whether a trend is present or not. \nSwing trading is buying at relative lows and selling at relative highs, \nregardless of whether the price is trending. Swing trading is more flex-\nible than trend-following, because you can apply the techniques under \ndifferent market conditions. However, the drawback to swing trading is \nthat it requires more frequent trading and the profit on each leg of the \ntrade tends to be smaller than in a single trend-following trade.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Sometimes you see a pause in an uptrend\narriving, and you know that early buyers are\nabout to take profit, setting off a domino effect\nof falling prices. You know that the uptrend is\nwell established, but instead of waiting for the\ntrend to end, you sell your position and also go\nshort today with the intention of exploiting just\nthis one small retracement down move. Selling\ninto an uptrend sounds counterintuitive. But\nin practice, retracements are fairly reliable.\nTrading the retracement is called fading the\ntrend, and it has become very popular in recent\nyears, especially in futures. Fading the trend\nworks best if the countertrend trade is very\nshort term (such as hours or days).\n\nWhen you fade the trend, you break a cardinal\nrule of technical trading — to trade with the\ntrend, which is based on the Dow principle that\nonce a trend is established, the probability is\nhigh that it will continue. Therefore, to fade the\ntrend is a purely opportunistic action based on\nan understanding of crowd psychology. Fading\nthe trend also illustrates that the frame of ref-\nerence of technical trading isn't the security\nand its fundamentals, but crowd behavior. Just\nremember, swing trading against the trend\nrequires lightning speed, total concentration,\nand nerves of steel.\n\nTo try to avoid making this mistake, you need to choose a core guiding prin-\nciple, either trend-following or swing trading (see Chapter 16).\n\nIf you choose trend-following, you choose to suffer through the downward\nbounce in an uptrend (or the upward bounce in a downtrend). And if you\nhave correctly identified the trend, your patience pays off and the trend\nresumes. If you choose swing trading, you need courage, because sometimes\nyou're trading against the trend. Remember that your choice of trending or\n\nswing-trading indicators determines your holding period. Trending indicators\n\ngenerally keep you in a trade for longer than swing-trading indicators.\n\nThe best guiding principles are the ones that relate directly to the supply and\n\ndemand dynamics that you can see on the chart. Simple, old-fashioned techniques,\nsuch as bar reading and pattern identification, are powerful. Math-based indicators\nare powerful, too, but if you find that you can’t describe market sentiment — what\nthe crowd is feeling — from a math-based indicator, don’t use it. Remember that\nusing just one indicator-based rule to guide your trading (whether judgment- or\nmath-based), such as buying when your security breaks a resistance line or selling\nwhen it falls below a moving average, can make or save you a bundle.\n\nExamining How Indicators Work\n\nIndicators aren’t inherently tied to particular time frames, nor do they have a\nsingle correct interpretation.

But you could use five days or any other number of periods for the\nindicator, and you could also sell when the indicator turns downward even if\nthe value is still above zero.\n\nIn the sections that follow, I describe the general way indicators work, but be\naware that technical traders are mavericks and use indicators in an infinite\nvariety of ways.\n\nFinding relevant time frames\n\nMost indicators measure price and volume changes relative to previous\nprices and volume over a specific lookback period, such as 12 days or 21\ndays. If you compare the trend-following chart in Figure 4-1 with the swing-\ntrading chart in Figure 4-2, you can easily deduce that trend-following uses\nindicators with a relatively longer time frame than swing-trading indicators.\n\nMost indicators have a range of time in which research shows they work best.\nMost charting software incorporates this info and comes with preformatted indi-\ncators with default parameters, such as 12 periods for the momentum indicator.\n\nA default parameter is only a starting point, and if 12 periods doesn’t work for\nyou as a momentum indicator, you're welcome to use a different number of\nperiods. Twelve periods is the default because researchers found it the best\nnumber over many thousands of price series. To adopt the default parameter\ndoes not mean that you must trade every 12 days if you use the momentum\nindicator to guide you. It means that looking back 12 periods from today\ntends to give you useful information. See Chapter 13 for more on momentum.\n\nMost indicators and patterns can stretch from a few minutes to several days\nor even many months, with a few exceptions. You wouldn’t use momentum,\nfor example, on a monthly chart but you could use it on 12-minute bars.\nSupport and resistance lines can be drawn on a chart of any time frame, and\nyou can often see patterns like a head-and-shoulders on 60-minute bars as\nwell as a chart containing a year of data. Technology offers the ability to put\nan indicator on the screen that traditionally used (say) 12 days — but today\nit can be 12 periods, and the period could be 15-minute bars. (See Chapter 6\nfor a discussion of intraday time frames.)\n\nThe ability to apply an indicator over any time frame reflects the fractal qual-\nity of prices — the weird and wonderful fact that without a label, a price series\nof 15-minute bars often can’t be distinguished from a month’s worth of daily\nbars. Intraday bars are like microcosms of daily bars, and daily bars are like\nmicrocosms of weekly or monthly bars. Traders respond to price changes in\nregular, consistent, and repetitive ways no matter the time frame.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You can use\nshort-term indicators to make long-term trades and the other way around.\nThousands of technical traders all vover the world are inventing new twists\nand tweaks on indicators all the time.\n\nHeeding indicator signals\n\nIndicators are designed to give buy and sell signals, although in many\ninstances, the signal is more like a warning and doesn’t have a black-and-\nwhite embedded decision rule. Indicators generate signals in three ways as I\ndescribe in the sections that follow — crossovers, meeting a range limit, and\nconvergence and divergence.\n\nCrossovers\n\nThe term crossover refers to one line crossing another line. Crossovers in\ntechnical analysis and trading include\n\nv The price crossing a fixed historic benchmark. (See the “Establishing\nBenchmark Levels” section, later in the chapter.)\n\nThe indicator crossing the price or the price crossing the indicator.\n(See Chapters 10 and 13 for support and resistance lines and moving\naverages).\n\nOne line of a two-line indicator crossing the other. (See information on\nthe moving average convergence/divergence indicator in Chapter 12.)\n\nIn most instances — but not all — the price crossing an indicator is named\n\na breakout, one of the most important concepts in technical analysis. When\na price rises above a long-standing resistance line, for example, technical\ntraders say it “broke out” of its previous trading range and now the sky’s the\nlimit — until the new range is established. Usually, you want to scrupulously\nobserve and measure a breakout. If the indicator line is at 10 and the price\ngoes to 12, it’s a breakout. If the price goes to 10.05, it’s also a breakout.\n\nThe word breakout itself tells you the crowd psychology behind the price\nmove. In an upside breakout, bullish sentiment triumphed. The bulls broke\nout of the enclosure and are cavorting in the pasture. When bearish senti-\nment wins, the bears have broken down the fence and are eating your prize\nroses. A breakout doesn’t necessarily imply a trend reversal, though; some-\ntimes a breakout is a confirming factor that the existing trend is gathering\nnew momentum or passing new benchmarks.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Oscillators are usually based on 100, so\nthey range from zero to 100, or minus 100 to plus 100, or some other varia-\ntion using the number 100.\n\nIn practice, traders find that usually the scope of the price range falls well\nunder the outer limits and doesn’t vary by more than 20 percent to 80 per-\ncent of the total possible range, so they draw a line at 20 percent of the\nmaximum range and another at 80 percent (or 10 percent and 90 percent, or\nsome other variation). When the indicator approaches one of the lines, the\nprice is nearing an extreme of its recent range. This is a warning of an over-\nbought or oversold condition and thus a potential retracement or reversal.\nDepending on whether you're a trend-follower or a swing trader, you may\nalter the amount of your position or alter your stop (see Chapter 5). If you're\na swing trader, you may use an actual crossover of the range lines as a buy/\nsell signal.\n\nConvergence and divergence\n\nConvergence refers to two indicator lines coming closer to one another, such\nas when a support line and a resistance line converge to form a triangle (see\nChapter 9) or two moving averages get closer together (see Chapter 13), indi-\ncating less difference between their numerical values. Convergence is most\noften seen in indicators on the price chart, and generally means that the\nprice action is starting to go sideways or has a narrower high-low range, or\nboth. A sideways move, in turn, generally leads to a breakout. Convergence\ndoes not have an embedded trading rule and is more often used as a warning\nthat a change in direction or the strength of a trend is changing.\n\nDivergence refers to two indicator lines moving farther apart, such as when\nthe spread between two moving averages widens. Divergence also refers to\nan indicator and the price going in different directions, and this is the most\ncommon and useful application of the observation. Momentum indicators,\nin particular, reshuffle the components of the price bar to come up with a\nprice’s rate of change, so that the slope of the indicator is a sophisticated\nmeasure of the strength of a trend. When the price is still rising (making new\nhighs) as the momentum indicator starts to fall (making progressively lower\nhighs), the price and indicator are diverging.\n\nDivergence is one of the few leading indicators in technical analysis and some-\nthing you should note as a warning of a possible trend change, although it, like\nconvergence, doesn’t have an embedded trading rule.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Chapter 4: Using Indicators to Trade Systematically 6 7\n\nEstablishing Genchmark Levels\n\navr\n\nSome price chart characteristics are inherent to the chart and not deliber-\nately placed indicators. Every price series has absolute highs and lows in\n\nits history. Technically, these characteristics aren’t indicators, and yet they\nmay serve to indicate future price action. You've probably heard the phrases\n“52-week high” or “52-week low,” meaning the security is reaching a one-year\nhigh or low. A new one-year high or low has no analytical value to the techni-\ncal trader — unless it’s also a historic high or low. A historic high or low is an\nabsolute level that becomes a benchmark.\n\nExamples of historical highs are the all-time high in the S&P 500 at 1553.11 in\nMarch 2000 that was not bested until October 2007 at 1565.42. Another exam-\nple is the all-time high in spot gold at $850 in January 1980, not surpassed\nuntil 2010.\n\nAs in these cases, when a price makes a new historic high or low and then\nretreats in the other direction, years can pass before the benchmark is\nmatched again. In the meantime, intermediate highs and lows emerge and\nbecome benchmarks in their own right. At the time they occur, they seem\n“historic.” After a bounce up off a new low, traders hesitate to break it, but\nafter they do, the price accelerates to the next low. The same thing happens\non the way up to new highs. Profit taking after a high causes the price to dip,\nand traders hesitate to breach the new “historic” high. Historic levels are\nmagnetic — they attract some traders to try to break them — but they are\nalso barriers. Hesitation ahead of the breach of a benchmark price can be\nprolonged, demonstrating that traders are fully aware of “historic levels.”\n\nHistoric levels are a cause and an effect of strange indicator behavior. If an\nuptrending indicator like the moving average flattens out mysteriously, widen\nthe time frame on your chart to see whether the price is near a historic level.\nThe market is going to test the old high. If the test fails, expect a retracement\nand maybe a reversal. If the price passes the test and makes a new high, you\nexpect the price to accelerate with high momentum and deliver a juicy profit.\nSee the discussion on momentum in Chapter 13.\n\nChoosing Indicators\n\nThe good news is that everything works, at least some of the time. Moving\naverage indicators work (see Chapter 12). Channel breakouts work (take a\npeek at Chapter 11). Trading in a three-to-five-day time frame with candle-\nstick analysis works (see Chapter 8). But indicators only indicate. They don’t\ndictate the next price move.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "68 Part Il: Preparing Your Mind for Technical Analysis\n\nar\n\nBER\n\nAll newcomers to technical analysis (and many old hands as well) tend to lose\nsight of the limitations of indicators. Folklore says that technical traders are\nalways seeking the Holy Grail, or the perfect indicator or combination of indi-\ncators that is right 100 percent of the time. It doesn’t exist. One of the reasons\nit doesn’t exist is that you are different from the next guy. Equally important,\nyou change over time. The ideal indicator that delivered great profits ten years\nago is one that you now avoid as carrying too much risk. In other words, an\nindicator is only what you make of it — how you apply it.\n\nThe old joke has it, “Give 12 technical traders a new indicator, and a year\nlater you have 12 different track records.” How you use an indicator isn’t set\nby the indicator itself, but by the trading rules you use. Indicators and trad-\ning rules have a chicken-and-egg relationship. The process of selecting and\nusing indicators involves not only the characteristics of the indicator, but\nalso a consideration of the trading rules you must employ to make the indica-\ntor work properly for you.\n\nFor example, you may like an indicator but find it generates too many trades\nin a fixed period, so you don’t execute every single signal. Someone else may\nuse the identical indicator, but instead of overriding indicator signals with\npersonal judgment like you, he modifies the exact timing of trades by using a\nsecond indicator. I talk about combining indicators in Chapter 16.\n\nModifying indicators with trading rules is always better than overriding them.\nTo override your indicator haphazardly is self-defeating. You're letting emo-\ntion back in. Plus, you won't get the expected result from the indicator — and\nthen you'll blame the indicator. Fortunately, most indicators are fairly flexible.\nThey can be adapted to fit the trading style you prefer, such as the frequency\nof your trades. Indicators are about price-move measurement. Trading rules\nare about you and your tolerance for risk. Trading rules must be appropriate\nto the indicators you choose. In short, don’t pick indicators that you can’t\nfollow, like a momentum indicator that gives ten trading signals per month\nwhen you don’t have the time or inclination to trade that often.\n\nOptimizing: Putting Indicators\nto the Test\n\nThe first step in seeing whether a given indicator can work for you is to test\nhow it would have worked in the past. You expect price patterns to repeat,\nbecause crowd psychology doesn’t change much. Optimization is the process\nof testing a hypothesis on historical data (backtesting) to discover which\nparameter would’ve worked the best. In practice, the terms backtesting and\noptimization are used interchangeably.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In keeping with the empirical approach, try various \nindicators and different parameters in the indicators to see what works.\nI say that optimization is evil because common sense tells you that condi-\ntions are never exactly the same and what worked on historical data may not \nwork in the future. Backtests to find good indicators and optimum param-\neters give you a sense of accuracy and reliability that is almost always mis-\nleading. Keep reading for more on optimization.\nConstructing a backtest optimization\nBacktesting is a valuable exercise that delivers a measure of how well an indi-\ncator parameter might work — in a situation where you have no other evi-\ndence that the indicator will work at all. Backtesting is better than eyeballing \nmultiple versions of the indicator on a chart.\nA popular place to start backtesting indicators on your security is the simple \nmoving average crossover. The goal of the backtest is to find x, which is the \nnumber of days in the moving average that would generate the best profit by \nusing a crossover rule (See Chapter 12). Here’s the formal hypothesis: “If you \nbuy XYZ stock every time the price crosses above the x-day moving average \nand sell it every time the price crosses below the x-day moving average, it’ll \nconsistently and reliably be a profitable trading rule.”\nJust about every software package allows you to search for the optimum \nmoving average and will deliver the results in minutes. In this case, I ordered \nthe software to test every moving average from 10 to 50 days over the past \n1,000 days to see which moving average would have delivered the most profit \non XYZ stock (the name is withheld to protect the innocent). I also ordered a \nbuy-only strategy, although you can also test for additional gains from going \nshort (to sell today without owning the security and buy it back later after \nthe price has fallen). You can see the top-three best results in Table 4-1.\n Table 4-1  \nResults of Simple Moving Average \n \nCrossover Backtest on XYZ Stock\nNumber of Days in \nMoving Average\nAverage Profit/Loss\nPercent Gain\nNumber \nof Trades\n10\n$1.56\n68.60%\n178\n31\n$3.02\n59.34%\n32\n35\n$3.32\n61.69%\n47\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Is that a good number?\nOne way to judge is to compare it to buy-and-hold; in other words, buying\n\non Day | and selling on Day 1,000. In this case, the software calculated the\nbuy-and-hold return as 43.4 percent, so for all that trading work, you made an\nadditional 25.2 percent. On a $10,000 starting capital stake, that’s $2,520. Or did\nyou? I didn’t include brokerage and other costs in this calculation.\n\nAlways look at an indicator backtest after slippage. Slippage is the reduction in\ntrading profits that arises from the cost of trading. It includes not getting the\nexact price on your screen, having to trade on the opening price because your\nindicator didn’t give you the signal until yesterday’s close was in, the bid-offer\nspread, commissions, and fees. Checking the indicator’s performance after\nslippage can make all the difference between a profitable trading rule and an\nunprofitable one.\n\nIn Table 4-2, factoring in the cost of slippage now makes the 31-day version of\nthe simple moving average the better choice.\n\nTable 4-2 Results of Simple Moving Average Crossover\nBacktest on XYZ Stock Incorporating\n$10 Per-Trade Slippage\nNumber of Days in Average Profit/Loss Percent Number of\nMoving Average Gain Trades\n10 $0.36 28.60% 178\n31 $2.70 49.34% 32\n35 $2.10 31.69% 47\n\nRefining a backtest\n\nIn the simple moving average crossover tests in Tables 4-1 and 4-2, I used\none criterion for selecting the optimum moving average — percent gain. But\npercent gain is not the only goal. If percent gain were the only goal, you could\nfind yourself accepting a trading regime that delivers 100 losing trades for\nevery 10 winning trades. The ten winners must each be a home run to make\nup for all those losses. But you are looking for systematic trading, not a few\nhome runs that may not repeat in the next 1,000 days. Therefore you also\ncare about the number of winning trades versus losing trades and about the\naverage win-loss ratio. You want as few losing trades as possible and you\nwant to get more profit from the average winning trade than you lose on the\naverage losing trade.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

I also stipu-\nlated a $10 slippage cost of each trade. Table 4-3 shows two of the results.\n\nTable 4-3 Results of Two Moving Average Crossover\nBacktests on XYZ Stock\n\nShort-term Percent Total Total Winning Average\n\nMoving Average/ Gain Trades Trades/Total Gain/Loss\n\nLong-term Losing Trades\n\nMoving Average\n\nVersion 1: 10/73 58.60 8 6/2 1.75\n\nVersion 2: 5/10 63.48 147 47/100 0.56\n\nThe average gain-loss column indicates that Version | makes less profit than\nVersion 2, but takes only eight trades over the 1,000 days.

Most traders will zoom in on that win-loss ratio and pick the top\ncombination for the lower number of trades and the higher average gain-loss\nratio, even at the expense of some profit.\n\nBacktesting never delivers a single, no-brainer parameter. Even after factor-\ning in brokerage and slippage costs, you still have to choose between the\nparameter that calls for more trades over one that calls for fewer trades, and\nbetween one that delivers more winning trades than losing trades, and the one\nthat delivers a better win-loss ratio. You hardly ever find a parameter for your\nindicator that meets all three criteria.\n\nFixing the indicator\nThe two moving average crossover backtest results in Table 4-3 highlight\n\nsome of the common problems you encounter when you begin backtesting\nindicators.

You therefore need to find adjustments to the indicator to reduce\nthe number of trades without damaging the returns from the winning trades.\nOne solution is to filter the buy/sell signals by specifying that you want the\nsoftware to generate a buy/sell signal only if the price is x percent above or\nbelow the moving average or has been above or below the moving average by\ny amount of time. Most indicators can be filtered in this way.\n\nLosing trades\n\nThe single best way to reduce your losing trades is to add a confirmation\nrequirement, such as one of the momentum indicators. In fact, in my own\nexperience, adding 12-day momentum as an additional requirement can\nreduce the number of trades by 30 to 50 percent without sacrificing much\nprofit. And because the trades being eliminated by momentum confirmation\nare generally losing trades, the gain-loss ratio improves, too.\n\nApplying the indicator again\n\nAfter choosing your indicator parameter, your job isn’t finished. Backtests are\nhypothetical. You didn’t actually make those trades. To get a more-realistic\nidea of how an indicator-based trading rule works, backtest the rule on his-\ntorical price data and then apply it to out-of-sample data. In the XYZ case in\nTable 4-1 and 4-2, for example, I backtested on 1,000 days of data. Now I should\nbacktest it on the next 500 days of data. If the results are about the same on the\nfresh data, you consider your rule to be robust, meaning it works across a wide\nrange of conditions.\n\nEvaluating the risks of backtesting\n\nThe flaw in optimization is that the ideal parameter for an indicator is ideal\nonly for the past. Critics of backtesting point out that even if your indicator is\nrobust on the next 500 days of out-of-sample data, after you actually add that\n500 days to the backtest, the perfect parameter is now some other number.\nYou can go mad backtesting until you are blue in the face, and you will never\nfind the optimum parameter that stays the same over time.\n\nThe unreliability factor gets worse if you fiddle with the indicator with filters.\nThis is named curve-fitting, or making the indicator perfect for the past. The\nprobability of that indicator being perfect for the future is low, because the\nmarket is dynamic and changes.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n[Formulas: 47/100]",

You start with a plan.\nYour trading plan outline\nYou may think that you can do it the easy way, by having a technical expert \nsend you a newsletter or a password to a technical Web site that gives you \nthe magic trade of the day. The expert may even explain and illustrate the \ntechnique. But when it fails — and they always fail at some point — you end \nup poorer and probably pretty mad at the charlatan who sold you a trading \nprogram based on MACD, the stochastic oscillator, or something else you \ncould have done yourself without paying a big subscription fee. You may \neven walk away saying technical analysis is hokum.\nThe fault lies not in the “magic” indicator but in the trader, or rather the trad-\ner’s lack of a trading plan. Good trading isn’t about the securities you trade \nor about indicators. It’s about planning the trade in full ahead of time and fol-\nlowing the plan. Strictly speaking, managing the trade isn’t exclusive to tech-\nnical analysis. But all successful technical traders manage their trades.\nAt each step you have to decide which indicators or combinations of indica-\ntors to follow, and your exact specifications for them. Here’s what your indi-\ncators and rules need to do:",

If you do the other steps but neglect Step 4,\nyou will not succeed in trading. The paramount rule in technical trading is to\ncontrol losses. You can pick so-so securities and apply so-so indicators to\nthem, and if you’re trading systematically, you can still make a decent net gain\nif you only control losses.\n\nCommon questions and concerns\n\nThe overall subject of money management is a big one, and I can’t hope to\ncover more than some basics here. However, I address some of the most fre-\nquent queries about technical trading in this section:\n\nHow much should | put into technical trading? Ten percent of my cap-\nital? Fifty percent? No single correct answer exists. You have to decide\nthis one on your own. You might start out with 10 percent and move\nit up to a higher proportion as you gain expertise and confidence. One\nthing is for sure: You should never start technical trading with a stop\nthat costs more than you can bear. Van Tharp, the author of the book\nDefinitive Guide to Position Sizing, offers a sensible methodology that\nkeeps us away, mostly, from the horrors of fancy mathematics.\n\nHow much risk should I take? Before you enter a new position, you\nshould define your initial risk, which is the dollar amount you are willing\nto lose if the trade goes bad. If your security is priced at $8, you could\nset your initial risk at $2. Tharp calls this number R and notes that if dif-\nfers from the usual definition of financial risk that involves variance as\nmeasured by the standard deviation. (See Chapter 14 for some digestible\ninformation about the standard deviation.)\n\nThe amount of loss you embed in your stop-loss should be limited to R\nor a fraction of R. In this example, that means your stop-loss would entail\nlosing less than $2, say $1.50. Your expected gain should be a multiple\n\nof R, meaning you would risk a loss of $1.50 only to make more than $2.\nOkay, how much more? Let’s say you are willing to risk losing $1.50 only\nif you can make twice R, or $4. This level of risk ensures that on average,\nyour gains are bigger than your losses.\n\nNow you examine your security in the context of a possible $5.50 price\nswing over your expected holding period. If the maximum high-low\nrange of your security is $3, you have no chance of making $4 (unless\nvolatility changes), but you still have a chance of seeing your $1.50 stop\nget hit. You need to modify your expected gain to no more than $3. Now\nyour risk-reward ratio is 2:1, meaning that you should make $2 for every\n$1 you lose over the course of many trades in this one security.\n\nHow many securities should I trade? As a general rule, you want more\nthan one security as a form of diversification (which reduces the risk of\nlosing it all in a single event), but less than 20 securities (which would\nrequire too much analysis even for a full-time trader). Three to five secu-\nrities are about right, especially for a newcomer.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n1/",

Again according to Tharp, \nyou can add up the R values for each of your securities and average \nthem, giving you the expected return. If you are not happy with this \nnumber, you can alter the portfolio to include securities with a higher \nor lower R to shift the average. Similarly, you can take the square root \nof the mean R of the portfolio to measure its variance, and if that is a \nnumber that is too high or low for you, you can alter the composition of \nthe portfolio.\n \n✓ How do you allocate your capital among the securities you’re trading? \nYou can divide it up equally, or you can allocate a higher percentage \nto the security getting the most winning trades over the past 30, 60, or \n90 days. You can also allocate according to the volatility of the security \n(check out Chapter 14 for more on volatility).\n \n Finally, you can apply fixed fractional position sizing, popularized by \nRalph Vince, which calls for allocation as a function of total possible loss \nas a fixed percentage of total capital. Say you have $10,000 in capital and \nyou want to buy Blue Widget stock at $40 per share. You set your stop at \n$2, meaning you will sell if it reaches $38. At the same time, you want to \nlimit the possible loss on Blue Widget to 2.5 percent of your total port-\nfolio, or $250. Therefore, you can buy no more than 6.3 shares of Blue \nWidget.\n \n Buying only 6 shares (an odd-lot, where a standard lot is 100 shares) \ncan be done but at a high commission cost. You need to pick a lower-\npriced stock, reduce your stop, or raise the percentage of your portfolio \ndedicated to a single security. Even if you plan not to use fixed fractional \nposition sizing, remember that this example embodies the spirit of man-\naging the trade.\nTaking Money off the Table: Establishing \nthe Profit Target\nWhen you have a gain in a trade, how much is enough? How do you know \nwhen to take profits? Unfortunately, few gurus offer guidance on how to \ndesign a take-profit rule. You never know at the beginning of a trend how long \nit will last, or how far it will go. The central issue in managing the trade is that \nyou can have control over the size of your losses (via stop-losses), but very \nlittle control over the size of the gains. You can buy a stock at $5 and make \nsure that you only lose $2, but you cannot force the stock to go to $9.\nIn practice, each individual trader develops his own technique that is a com-\nbination of risk analysis and indicator readings. The optimum way to take \nprofit is, in fact, one of the great, unexplored frontiers of technical trading. \nHere are some choices for selecting a profit target:\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "79\n Chapter 5: Managing the Trade\n \n✓ Name a dollar amount. Logically, you are compensated by an amount \nthat is a multiple of the risk you are taking. This is the Tharp approach I \nmention in the section, “Common questions and concerns.” You set your \ninitial risk at $2 and are willing to accept a loss of a fraction of that, or \n$1.50. Your profit target is double initial risk, or $4. Because the security \ninitially costs $8, you seek a 50 percent return. This expected gain may \nor may not be realistic depending on your holding period, changes in \nvolatility, and other factors. After you have made the 50 percent, how-\never, you obey the target and exit the trade when it reaches $12. The \nproblem with this approach, of course, is that the price may keep on \nrising and then you have an opportunity loss if it reaches (say) $20.\n \n✓ Set a true-range amount. Your security, historically, has an average \nhigh-low range of $10 over 20 periods, your expected holding period. \nYou want to capture 75 percent of the range, or $7.50. Because you use \nindicators to time your entry, you assume that you are entering at the \nlow end of the range; therefore, 75 percent is realistic. When the price \nreaches your target, you take profit.\n \n The problem with this approach is twofold: The range can widen or \nnarrow. If it widens, you aimed too low and if it narrows, your original \ntarget is too ambitious. Second, how do you sit through a pullback? \nYou may have met the goal of entering at a low only to have an aberrant \npullback take the price down 30 percent rather than up 75 percent. This \nmovement was not enough to hit your stop but now your profit target \nis $10.50 away from the current price. Because you know the average \nrange is $10, the probability of meeting your $7.50 target within your \nholding period just went out the window.\n \n✓ Rely on indicators. Instead of formulating take-profit rules, most techni-\ncal traders rely on indicators to signal when a move has ended — the \nsignal is the de facto take-profit rule. Relying on indicators is “winging \nit” and actually requires more market monitoring than the fixed dollar \namount or average true-range methods, which deliver a number you can \nconvert into a standing order with your broker.\nControlling Losses\nYour level of risk seeking or risk aversion is personal. Therefore, nobody can \ndesign rules for you. You must do it for yourself. Ask yourself whether you’d \nfaithfully follow every buy/sell signal generated by a given indicator when the \nbacktest of the indicator predicts that you will have some individual trades \nthat entail a loss of 50 percent of your trading capital. No?\nWell, how much of your trading capital are you prepared to lose? This is not an \nidle question. Your answer is critical to whether you succeed in technical trad-\ning. If you say you can accept no losses at all, forget technical trading. You will \ntake losses in technical trading. If you say that you’re willing to lose 50 percent \nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Three or four losing trades in\narow and you would not have enough capital left to do any trades. I offer some\nhelp in deducing your personal number in the following sections.\n\nExperienced traders ask themselves, “How much will I lose today?” when they\nwake up every morning. They expect loss on some level. In contrast, beginners\nfind losses almost impossible to contemplate. Yet if you don’t control losses,\nthe question is not whether you go broke, but when you go broke (as a famous\ntrader named W.D. Gann wrote on the very first page of one of his books).\n\nExiting a losing trade is the single hardest thing to do in trading. For one\nthing, exiting means that your indicator let you down. Accept that your indi-\ncators have shortcomings and that your job is to overcome those shortcom-\nings by using money-management rules.\n\nA bigger problem may be your bruised ego. To sell a losing position means\n\nthat you failed, and the standard response to a loss is denial. “It will come\nback!” you cry. In the long run, maybe it will come back. But by then, you may\nbe broke and unable to take advantage of it. Flip back a few pages and look at\nTable 1-1 in Chapter 1 that shows the percentage gain that you need to recover\na loss. To recover a 50 percent loss, you need to make a 100 percent gain.\n\nEvery top trader admits to taking bigger losses than they planned. Many go\nout of business for a period of time, only to come back later with essentially\nthe same indicators — and better ways to manage the trade. In fact, some\ninvestors say that the best time to place money with a professional trader is\nright after he has taken a fat loss — because then he’s a better trader. Note\nthat such investors aren’t predicting he will be a better indicator analyst, but\na better trader.\n\nUsing the First Line of Defense:\nStop-Loss Orders\n\nPas\n\nYou use a stop-loss order to overcome the unreliability of indicators as well as\nyour own emotional response to losses. A sfop-oss order is an order you give\nyour broker to exit a trade if it goes against you by some amount. For a buyer,\nthe stop-loss order is a sell order. For a seller, it’s a buy order.\n\nIf market conditions are choppy (high volatility), you may want to widen your\nstop even though your own particular security is behaving nicely. In this\ninstance, you fear an overflow effect from the general market to your particu-\nlar security. You may switch from a money-based trailing stop like the 2 per-\ncent rule to a volatility or pattern type of stop.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You\nabsolutely need to understand stops to trade successfully.\n\nMental stops are hogwash\n\nYou should enter your stop-loss order at the same time you enter the posi-\ntion. In fact, you need to know the stop in order to calculate how big a posi-\ntion to take in the first place, if you’re using any risk-management rule. Why\nsome traders don’t do this is a mystery. Many traders say they keep a mental\nstop in their heads, but this “method” is a delusion. The trader is conning\nhimself into thinking that he’ll be watching the price every minute the market\nis open and will have the gumption to sell at a loss if the limit is reached.\n\nBut no one can watch the market every minute, and in practice, most trad-\ners with mental stops sit hopelessly by as the trade goes further and further\nagainst them.\n\nOther traders say that their security isn’t suitable for stops because it’s too\nvolatile. Or the trader is so big that the market would find out where his\nstops are and maliciously target them. Another rationalization is that the\ntrader’s stops get hit, and often, only for the price to move back in the origi-\nnal direction right afterwards. This excuse isn’t a reason to avoid using stop-\nlosses. It’s a reason to reset the stop to a better level.\n\nTo pretend that you have a mental stop or to refuse to place stops is to avoid\naccepting the reality of trading — it’s a business, and setbacks happen in busi-\nness. Setting a stop-loss order is like buying insurance in case the store burns\ndown. Not to take out insurance is to treat trading as a hobby and view the\namount at stake as play money rather than as risk capital.\n\nSorting out the types of stops\n\nTechnical traders have developed many stop-loss principles. Each concept\nis either a fixed trading rule or a self-adjusting one. Stops relate to indicators,\nmoney, or to time, and often these three don’t line up neatly to give you an\neasy decision. You have to choose the type of stop that works best for you.\n\nThe 2 percent stop rule\n\nProbably the most famous stop-loss rule is the fixed 2 percent rule that was\nemployed by a trading group named the Turtles. The 2 percent rule states that\nyou should stop a loss when it reaches 2 percent of starting equity. If you’re\ntrading risk capital of $10,000, you can afford to lose no more than $200 on any\nsingle trade if you expect to stay in business for a long period of time. The 2\npercent rule is an example of a money stop, which names the amount of money\nyou're willing to lose in a single trade.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You need only 50 losing trades in\na row to go broke. And 50 trades may sound like a lot of trades, but you find\nthat many valid indicators have you trading that often, depending on your\ntime frame. If you’re trading 15-minute or 60-minute bars, you could easily\nhave more than 100 trades in a month.\n\nAlthough your indicators should be better than to have 50 consecutive losses\nin a single security, if you’re trading several securities, 50 is no longer a large\nnumber. If you’re trading five securities, for example, you go broke after ten\nconsecutive losses per security.\n\nRisk-reward money stops\n\nThe risk-reward ratio puts the amount of expected gain in direct relationship\nto the amount of expected loss, as in the Tharp approach I mention in the\n“Common questions and concerns” section in this chapter. The higher the\nrisk-reward ratio, the more desirable the trade. Say, for example, that you’re\nbuying Blue Widget stock at $5 and your indicators tell you that the potential\ngain is $10, which means that the stock could go to $15. You could set your\ninitial stop at $2.50, or 50 percent of your capital stake, for the chance to\nmake $10. That gives you a risk-reward ratio of 10:2.5, or 4:1. (Strangely, the\namount of the gain, the reward, is always placed first in the ratio, even though\nit comes second in the name.)\n\nBut consider the premise from this example — your ending capital triples\nyour initial stake. But gee, expecting a 300 percent return is going a bit far,\nisn’t it? Well, it depends on your skills. If you consistently forecast and get\n300 percent gains, good for you. You may be able to accept a higher initial\nstop-loss level than other mere mortals.\n\nTo apply the risk-reward ratio in a conservative and prudent manner, turn it\nupside down. Instead of calculating it with your best-case expected gain, use\na realistic worst-case estimate of the gain. Your worst-case gain should be\nhigher than your worst-case loss. For example, say you're prepared to lose $2\nfor the chance to make $4. Your risk-reward ratio is 4:2, or 2:1. If you practice\nthis exercise on every trade, the risk-reward ratio becomes a filter that win-\nnows out trades that may be high probability but with excessive risk.\n\nCalculating the risk-reward ratio and using it to set a stop has its own dangers. In\nthe Blue Widget case above, you're willing to lose 50 percent of your capital. If you\nlose, you can take only a few such trades before you run out of money. Moreover,\nyou can start out with a fixed risk-reward money stop but then change it to an\nadjustable stop as you modify your idea of how much the trade could potentially\ngain. Say the price falls from $5, your original entry, to $3.50. But the average\nrange is widening and still telling you the potential high price is $15. If you buy\nmore at $3.50 and the $15 is indeed reached, your gain is even bigger in percent-\nage terms. Using the risk-reward ratio this way is how traders trick themselves\ninto adding to losing positions, the blackest of cardinal sins in trading.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But just remember that in technical trading, the general rule is to\ntake small losses and aim for bigger gains, not to take big losses and aim for\ngigantic gains.\n\nMaximum adverse excursion\n\nJohn Sweeney developed the concept of maximum adverse excursion, which is\nthe statistically determined worst-case loss that may occur during the course\nof your trade. Using this method, you calculate the biggest change in the high-\nlow range over a fixed period (say 30 days) that’s equivalent to your usual\nholding period. Actually, you need to calculate the maximum range from the\nentry levels you would’ve used. Because you know your entry rules, you can\nbacktest to find the maximum range that was prevalent at each entry.\n\nFor example, if the security never changes from high to low by more than\n$10 over the period, you could set your stop at $11. You should see a regu-\nlar pattern between the maximum adverse excursion and your winning and\nlosing trades over time. In fact, you can use the inverse of the adverse excur-\nsion, the maximum favorable excursion, to select trades in the first place. See\nChapter 14 on volatility.\n\nTrailing stops\n\nTrailing stops use a dynamic process that follows the price: You raise the\nstop as the trade makes profits. A trailing stop is set on a money basis — you\nmaintain the loss you can tolerate at a constant dollar amount or percentage\nbasis. You could, for example, say that you want to keep 20 percent of each\nday’s gain, so every day you'd raise the stop day to include 80 percent of\n\nthe day’s gain. This method means calling the broker or reentering the stop\nelectronically every day. The important point is to keep the stop updated to\nprotect gains and guard against losses at the same time.\n\nTrailing stops are highly protective, but you risk being stopped out on an arbi-\ntrary price event that isn’t really related to the overall price trend. Some trad-\ners object to the trailing stop on the grounds that the normal average daily\ntrading range almost certainly encompasses the trailing stop level on many\noccasions. A random event can cause a small spike, for example.\n\nIndicator-based stops\n\nIndicator-based stops depend on the price action and the indicators you use\nto capture it. Indicator stops can be either fixed or self-adjusting. I mention\nthem at various places throughout the book; here are some important ones:\n\n Last-three-days rule: The most basic of stop-loss rules is to exit the\nposition if the price surpasses the lowest low (or highest high if you’re\ngoing short) of the preceding three days. This idea sounds a little corny.\nHowever, it jibes well with another piece of trading lore that says a trade\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

If \nthe price first rises for a day or two but can’t hold on to the gain, the up \nmove that you think you’ve identified is probably a false one. Consider \nthe crowd dynamics (see Chapter 2) and how they play out on the price \nbar (covered in Chapter 6). You need a series of higher highs and higher \nlows to name an uptrend. If you get a lower low in the first three days, \nthe probability is good that the trade is going south.\n \n✓ Pattern stops: Pattern stops relate directly to market sentiment and are \nvery handy. Most are of the fixed variety. I list a few below:\n \n• The break of a support or resistance line is a powerful stop level, \nchiefly because so many other traders are drawing the same lines.\n \n• The last notable high or low (the historic level; see Chapter 4) or \nthe high or low of an important time period, like a year, are note-\nworthy.\n \n• You can infer stops from other pattern indicators, such as the \ncenter confirmation point of the W in a double bottom or the M \nin a double top (see Chapter 9). When the confirmation point is \nsurpassed, the probability is high that the move continues in the \nexpected direction. If you’re positioned the wrong way when the \npattern appears, the pattern confirmation is also your stop level.\n \n✓ Moving-average stop: You can also use a separate indicator that isn’t \npart of your buy/sell repertoire to set a stop, such as a moving average \n(see Chapter 12). You may not use a moving average because of its lag-\nging nature, but many traders use a breakout beyond the 10-day moving \naverage as a warning to reduce a position, and the 20-day moving aver-\nage as a stop. You may find it interesting how often a retracement will \npenetrate a 10-day moving average but halt just short of crossing the \n20-day moving average. A moving-average stop is clearly of the self-\nadjusting variety.\nVolatility stops are the most complex of the indicator-based, self-adjusting \nstops to figure out and to apply, but they’re also the most in tune with market \naction. Many variations are available. Here are three of particular interest:\n \n✓ Parabolic stop-and-reverse model: Invented by Welles Wilder, the para-\nbolic concept is easy to illustrate and hard to describe. The principle \nis to create an indicator that rises by a factor of the average true range \n(see Chapter 7) as new highs are being recorded, so that the indicator \naccelerates as ever-higher highs are met and decelerates as less-high \nhighs come in. In an uptrend, the indicator is plotted just below the \nprice line. It diverges from the price line in a hot rally, and converges to \nthe price line as the rally loses speed. See Figure 5-1. The parabolic stop \nis both self-adjusting and trailing — a rare combination.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The average true-range channel is described in\nChapter 14. You take the average daily high-low range of the price bars,\nadjusted for gaps, and expand it by adding on a constant, like 25 percent\nof the range. Say your average daily trading range is $3. If the price goes\nmore than 25 percent beyond the $3 high-low range, you consider it an\nextreme price and the signal to exit. The average true-range stop has the\nvirtue of being self-adjusting, but it also has the drawback of setting a\nstop that has nothing to do with your entry.\n\nChandelier exit: This stop solves the entry-level issue. Invented by\n\nChuck LeBeau, the chandelier exit sets the stop at a level below the\nhighest high or the highest close since your entry. You set the level as a\nfunction of the average true range. The logic is that you’re willing to lose\nonly one range worth (or two or three) from the best price that occurred\nsince you put on the trade. Like the parabolic stop, the chandelier is\nboth self-adjusting and trailing.\n\nIndicator stops usually entail taking a loss greater than the 2 percent bench-\nmark rule (see “The 2 percent stop rule” section on this topic). This factor\nhands you a hard decision. If you take the 2 percent rule, you have to live with\nthe remorse of exiting trades only to see the price move your way later on, the\ndreaded whipsaw. If you take an indicator rule that entails losses greater than\n2 percent of your capital, but have a series of losing trades early in your trad-\ning career, you could lose a lot of money before you figure out how to adapt\nand apply indicators.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n85",

Say you’re holding a position that \nstarts going sideways. It is reasonable to exit the trade and find a different \nsecurity that is moving. Remember, the purpose of trading is to make money.\nClock and calendar stops\nClock and calendar stops pertain to a price event happening (or not happen-\ning) considering the time of day, week, month, or year. Clock-based rules \nabound. Some technical traders advise against trading during the first hour in \nthe U.S. stock market, because buy- or sell-on-open orders are being executed \nthen (see Chapter 6). Others say that more gain can be had from the first \nhour than any other hour of the trading day if you can figure out which way \nthe crowd is trading. As I describe in Chapter 16, one setup technique is to \nbuy or sell the direction of an opening gap — and be done in an hour.\nIn foreign exchange, you often see prices retrace at the end of the European \ntrading day — about 11 a.m. in New York — as traders there close positions. \nNot only is this a swell entry place when you’re sure that you know the trend, \nbut it’s also a benchmark for the U.S. trading day. If the price fails to close \nhigher or lower than the European close, it means that American traders are \nhaving second thoughts about the trend.\nAdjusting Positions\nStops are the first line of defense against indicator failures and market catas-\ntrophes. But to exit a position is an extreme response when your uncertainty \nisn’t high. A stop is a blunt instrument when more delicacy may be called for. \n(For more on stops, see the earlier section, “Using the First Line of Defense: \nStop-Loss Orders.”)\nMost indicators are black and white. You should either buy or sell. They lack \nnuance. Similarly, stops are a one-way proposition. But often when you’re \nusing multiple indicators, you don’t get a clear-cut trading decision, or as the \ntrade progresses, one of your confirming indicators weakens and is no longer \noffering the comfort of full confirmation. Perhaps a pattern spells doom to \nyour position. You don’t use patterns and perhaps you don’t like patterns, \nbut it’s a nagging worry.\nAnother reason to adjust positions gradually instead of betting the ranch \non day one is to follow the confirmation principle (see Chapter 16). You can \nstart a new position by placing the first trade for one-quarter or one-third the \nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Likewise, you can reduce the size of your posi-\ntion as warnings arrive from indicators (such as momentum indicators like\nthe stochastic oscillator; see Chapter 13).\n\nPosition sizing can add or subtract from your bottom line by as much or more\nthan your choice of securities or indicators. When you get an itch to change\nposition size, consider whether it’s because your appetite has changed, or\nvariance has changed. Appetite may change because you just got a big bonus\nand are putting it all into your trading account. Now you're willing to take a\nbigger loss per trade. Or perhaps one of your securities makes a giant break-\nout, and the trend gathers steam in a straight line for an abnormally long\nperiod of time (with low volatility). Risk is (temporarily) lower.\n\nIn the fixed fractional allocation system I describe, you allocate capital\namong securities according to potential loss as a percentage of total capital.\nTherefore, scaling in or scaling out of each security by simply changing the\namount of loss you are willing to take on any single security is very easy.\nWillingness to increase the loss you may take automatically (and conve-\nniently) changes the number of shares or contracts you should be holding.\n\nTo increase the size of a position is called scaling in and to reduce the amount\nyou have at risk is scaling out. In the sections that follow, I go into more detail\non these terms and concepts.\n\nReducing positions\n\nThe safest way to reduce the risk of loss is to reduce exposure to it — start\nscaling out. If you’ve bought on an indicator-based signal but you think you\nknow of a fundamental reason why it’s not going to be a good trade, the two\nconflicting ideas may cancel each other out. Similarly, you may have a nicely\ntrending security and get a surprise stop hit that you don’t trust, because\nyou think you can identify the cause as an anomaly. Instead of being para-\nlyzed or not trading at all, you have a few options:\n\nDelay following the indicator signal until the nontechnical event risk\nis past. Some traders advise reducing (or exiting) positions ahead of\nknown event risks, such as central bank meetings, earnings announce-\nments, and national elections.\n\nStay in the trade, but reduce the amount of money you allocate to it (and\nperhaps tighten the stop). You can also hedge the risk in the options\nmarket or by taking the opposite position in a correlated security, but\non the whole, scaling out is the most direct and efficient method.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "SS Part Il: Preparing Your Mind for Technical Analysis\n\n\\NG/\ns\n\nAdding to positions\n\nYou can add to a position, or scale in, when your existing position is highly\nprofitable. Statisticians debate whether you should add to winning positions\nby using unrealized profits from the existing trade, called pyramiding. To pyr-\namid is to use hypothetical profits to enlarge your position. Say you started\nwith $1,000 and the trade has now generated another $1,000 in paper profits.\n\nWhy not borrow against that extra $1,000 to buy some more of this high-per-\nforming security? The answer is that if a catastrophe strikes and the trade\ngoes against you, your risk of loss can become huge — more than your origi-\nnal stake if your stop fails (or, heaven forbid, you didn’t place one). Be aware\nthat if you engage in pyramiding, you're taking a higher risk than if you don't.\nPyramiding without proper stops has probably caused more traders to go\nbroke than any other cause.\n\nIn addition to the fixed fractional rule I describe in an earlier section called\n“Common questions and concerns” in this chapter, other techniques for scal-\ning in and out include:\n\nIf you're using a 2 percent stop rule (see section on this topic), when the\nexisting position has gained a profit that is greater than the 2 percent of\nstarting capital you would have lost if the stop had been triggered, you\nadd the amount of the surplus profit to the position with its own 2 per-\ncent stop. The problem, of course, is that it’s awkward to trade in odd\nlots, and odd lots don’t even exist in futures.\n\nIf you’re using margin (where the trader puts down only a fraction of the\nvalue of the contract being traded), one rule of thumb is to add to the\nposition when the existing trade has earned the cost of the minimum ini-\ntial margin of a second position. If you’re trading on a 50 percent margin,\nyou add to the position when the existing position has racked up enough\npaper gain to fund the new position.\n\nThis rule is especially valuable in the futures market, in which the\ntrader puts down only a small fraction of the value of the contract being\ntraded. For example, if the initial margin required by the exchange and\nyour broker is $2,500, you don’t add a second contract to your position\nuntil the first contract has a profit of $2,500. By then, you figure that the\nmove is well in place. But remember, you have to have one stop-loss\norder on the first contract and a different one on the second trade.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The answer from statisticians is “maybe.” It depends on whether \nyou’re thinking in chart terms or money-management terms. If you’re using a \nbreakout concept to set your stop, for example, the price crossing a support \nline (see Chapter 10) is a sell signal that would apply equally to all positions.\nIf you’re using a 2 percent or other rule (like the chandelier exit I mention in \nthis chapter) that is calculated specifically with reference to your starting \npoint, you exit each trade according to the rule. This method has benefits \nand drawbacks. The benefit is that you’re still in the trade if the stop was \ntriggered for one trade but the price retracement is only a minor, temporary \none. You still have other positions left and if the price makes a big jump your \nway, you’re correctly positioned to take advantage of it. The drawback is that \na well-set stop may really identify a change in overall price behavior.

It may take a little practice to see, but inside each\ndot on the chart lies a world of information. The “dot” is really a price bar,\nwhich graphically represents all the transactions done in the security, reveal-\ning supply and demand at each point.\n\nIn this chapter, I define each component of the price bar. I demonstrate how\nto transform the numbers on the price bar from abstract dollar amounts into\nthe market sentiment of the participants in that security, either optimistic\n\nor pessimistic. You know the phrase “Actions speak louder than words”?\nReading price bars is the perfect application of that saying. Traders may say\nthat they feel optimistic about the price of the security going up, but the\nprice bar tells you what they really think by showing you what action they\ntook. Reading price bars is about being a detective examining the hard evi-\ndence — and disregarding witness accounts.\n\nBuilding Basic Bars\n\nThe price bar is the basic building block of technical analysis. After you have\na grip on the price bar, almost nothing in technical analysis can confuse you\nfor long. Honest. Resist the temptation to skim over the bar chart material\n\nto get to the more glamorous-sounding techniques.

Prices change from day to day in numerous ways,\nbut seldom in random or meaningless ways. Every major trend starts with a\nchange in the price bar on a single day or over only a few days, and the ear-\nlier you get in a new trend, the more profit you make. In Chapters 8 and 15, I\ndescribe two other ways of displaying price information, but right now, focus\non getting the components of the standard bar down cold.\n\nI start off here with a brief overview of the price bar and then detail each\npiece of it at length in the sections that follow.\n\nGetting in on the action:\nThe price bar in brief\n\nThe price bar describes and defines the trading action in a security fora\ngiven period. Trading action means all the real-money transactions conducted\nduring the period. The price bar measures actual deals done with cold, hard\ncash, not what somebody wished, imagined, or contemplated. For the sake of\nsimplicity, this chapter refers to a daily price bar because most of the time,\nyou're working with daily price information. As I explain later in this chapter,\na price bar can encompass different periods — anything from a minute to a\nmonth. But the scope of the period doesn’t change the price bar dynamics |\ndescribe in this chapter.\n\nCheck out the standard price bar in Figure 6-1. Like all bars, it consists of four\ncomponents:\n\nOpen: The little horizontal line on the left is the opening price.\nHigh: The top of the vertical line defines the high of the day.\n\nLow: The bottom of the vertical line defines the low of the day.\nClose: The little horizontal line on the right is the closing price.\n\nThis Open-High-Low-Close component set of the price bar is often abbrevi-\nated OHLC.\n\nThe two little horizontal lines on the price bar are called tick marks. In trad-\ning parlance, a tick represents a single trade at a single price, so the tick mark\nrepresenting the open or the close refers literally to a single transaction or to\na batch of transactions all at the same price and at the same time. The high\nand the low don’t need a tick mark because the end of the bar conveys that\ninformation.\n\nThe daily price bar shows the effects of every price factor in the market for\n\nthat day, including the overall environment, the fundamentals of the security,\nand the collective emotional condition of the traders in the security that day.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Hidden in every price bar are a winning group and a losing\ngroup. If the price opened at the low and closed at the high, the winners that\nday were the buyers. If the price opened at the high and closed at the low, the\nwinners that day were the sellers. You almost always have to take into consider-\nation the price action embedded in the bar the day before in order to make the\nwinner-loser judgment. For example, you can have an opening gap down from\nthe day before that still delivers a close at the high of the new bar — but that\nclose at the high is still lower than the close the day before. Who is the winner\non this day? Well, anyone who bought at today’s low (not the poor guy who\nhad bought the previous day).\n\nBut back to the single bar. Each bar reflects a very real contest — and you\nmeasure the outcome in money. If the bar is very tall, encompassing a $10\nrange when the normal bar for this security is only $3, the trading was a\nTitanic battle. If the bar is very short, say $1, it was a pillow fight. On every\nsingle trade, one party wins and the other party loses. That is why trading —\nlike war — is called a zero sum game.\n\nThe relationship between prices and volume is important in judging the bar.\nVolume is the number of shares or contracts traded during the period that\nyour bar encompasses. Everything that you infer about the state of mind of\nthe market participants is subject to confirmation by volume. For example,\n\nif the price bar is three times the usual size, you would want to verify that a\nlarge number of traders were active that day by looking at volume. It would\n\nbe wrong to see a trading battle if only one trade was done at the $10 high. In\nthat case, the $10 price is an anomaly. Somebody made a mistake — either the\nbuyer at $10 or the data collection department at the exchange.\n\nWhen you get befuddled by a tangle of patterns and indicators on your chart,\nreturn to the basics — a clean chart that contains only the price bars — and\nask yourself “What are these bars saying?” Chances are they are singing quite\na tune. Price bars are the raw material of indicators, so when indicators are\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

When you see the open in a newspaper or most data services, that num-\nbers is often not actually the first trade of the day, but a synthetic price (like\nan average of the first five trades) devised by the data collector (the exchange\nwhere the security is traded or a private data vendor like Reuters). This is why\nthe opening price varies from one data source to another. Not having accu-\nrate data drives some technical analysts wild because the opening price sets\nthe tone and if somebody made it up, it doesn’t matter how reasonable the\ncalculation process — it’s not literally the first price of the day. This problem\nis now compounded by the existence of several exchanges trading the same\nequity securities and related options.\n\nSome equity analysts say that they never look at the open because it’s not\nstrictly accurate. And although in futures trading the open is the real McCoy,\nin many instances (such as equity index futures and foreign exchange), trad-\ning has been going on in the overnight Globex market, so the actual open on\nthe U.S. exchange floor is hardly ever a surprise.\n\nSo should you heed the open? Yes. In equities, any particular opening price\nmay not be accurate, but over a series of days, the open adequately repre-\nsents the sentiment at the beginning of the day. Heed the opening price in\nfutures, too, including equity index futures. The open is your benchmark for\nevaluating the price action over the course of the day.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Whether the open is up or down, you can figure out how to evaluate\nthe opening price in the following sections. (For more on the close, see the\nsection “Summarizing sentiment: The closing price,” in this chapter.)\n\nWhen the open is up\n\nIf the open is up from the close the day before, you imagine that the first\ntrader of the day spotted overnight news favorable to the security, or is\nexpecting favorable news, or has some other reason to think his purchase\nwill return a gain. If you, too, want to be a buyer today, his action reinforces\nyour feeling. The first trade sets the tone.\n\nSometimes a good opening is due to a practice named buy on open. You\ncan’t automatically attribute optimism or hopefulness to an opening bounce,\nbecause\n\nMutual fund and other professional managers have preset allocations to\nspecific securities. When fresh money comes in the night before, these\nmanagers are going to distribute a certain percentage of it to all the\nsecurities in the fund selected by the new customer. To buy on open is\nthe easiest way to top up a fund, but this action is not necessarily a judg-\nment on that security that day.\n\nFund managers want to clean out stops from the day before. A sfop is a\npreset sell order usually designed to prevent losses or otherwise exit\nthe trade; see Chapter 5. A stop placed significantly beneath the close\nfrom the day before may be hit merely because all the market makers\nhave not refreshed their bids at the time the market opens. This type of\nbuying an open occurs particularly with more lightly traded issues, not\nthe big names trading millions of shares a day.\n\nFund managers and other professionals control far larger sums than indi-\nviduals do, and you don’t know what proportion of opening trades are due\nto genuine research-based enthusiasm and what proportion is due to the\nmechanical buy-on-open effect. The market can take up to an hour to get\ndown to new business.\n\nHow do you know whether an opening bounce is due to fresh enthusiasm or\njust the mechanical buy-on-open effect? You have to study each security to\nsee whether it normally displays the effect. Heavily traded, big-name securi-\nties (such as IBM stock) are less susceptible to an opening bounce than spe-\ncialized securities with a narrower trader base (like cocoa futures).\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Maybe\n\nbad news came out after the close last night. The bad news may pertain to a\npolitical event, a change in interest rates, a bankruptcy in the same industry,\nor a zillion other factors (see the discussion of events in the sidebar “Current\nevents: Buy on the rumor; sell on the news,” in this chapter).\n\nSome traders may have executed a sell on open, although to sell on the open\nis not acommon practice. A se/l-on-open order is just what it sounds like — an\norder given the night before to exit the trade at whatever the price happens\nto be, although hunting for stops at the open is widespread and can create\neither a buying or a selling surge (for more on stops, see the section, “When\nthe open is up”).\n\nSummarizing sentiment: The closing price\n\nThe closing price is literally the last price at which a buyer bought and a\nseller sold before the closing bell. The close is the most important part of\nthe price bar. In fact, if you were to draw a chart by using only one of the\nbar components, you’d usually pick the close. A set of closes over a small\nnumber of days is an indicator in its own right. The close remains the most\nimportant price bar component even though after-the-bell trading was intro-\nduced to the retail market in the early 2000s.\n\nThe close is the most important part of the price bar because it summarizes\nwhat traders feel about the security. They’ve watched this price all day, and by\nthe end of the day, they have a sense of how popular it was near the lows (lots\nof buying going on) or how unpopular near the highs (lots of selling going on).\nRemember, they're also looking at volume to confirm these impressions. As the\nclose approaches, traders have to decide whether to hold the security over-\nnight, a course of action they take only if they think it’s going up farther tomor-\nrow and they won’t be able to get it more cheaply than they already have.\n\nNote also that the close is what brokers use to value your portfolio at the\nend of an accounting period, and the close is used to calculate the “mark-to-\nmarket” value of a futures position. Professionals whose job performance\ndepends on end-of-period accounting care passionately about the close and\nyou may sometimes see them engineering a higher close in the last few min-\nutes of trading.\n\nAfter-hours trading creates a problem in evaluating the close. How do you\ntreat the close when your security makes a new high or new low in after-\nhours trading — only ten minutes after the close? The answer is that you\ndon’t adjust the close.

Here the sellers are willing to take ever-lower\nprices to get rid of the security. The market assumes that those holding an\ninventory of the security are willing to sell at lower and lower prices in order\nto get buyers to demand it. This action is the same as your auto dealer put-\nting last year’s cars on sale just before the new models come in. By lowering\nthe price, he creates demand. When you see a down move like the one in\nFigure 6-3, you should join the crowd and be a seller.\n\nDAY 3\n\nHope, fear, and risk management at the close\n\nOn an up day, you hear that “today the bulls won” or on a down day, “today\nthe bears won.” This talk of bulls and bears acknowledges the emotional\naspect of trading — bulls are buyers who are hopeful of higher prices later\nthat they can sell for a profit, and bears are pessimists who foresee prices\nfalling. You can also say that the bulls are motivated by greed and the bears\nare motivated by fear. However, greed and fear aren’t the only emotions trad-\ners feel, and some even find the use of the word greed offensive. Traders also\nmake buy/sell decisions to manage risk, a nonemotional reason.\n\nJust as some traders buy on the open as a standard practice, some traders sell\non the close, chiefly to eliminate the risk of loss if something were to happen\novernight that would cause the price to fall. Institutions as well as individu-\n\nals use his simple risk-management tactic. Should you? Only if you’re trading\nwithout a stop or you fear the market could gap over your stop.\n\nBecause so many people exit on the close, the close is seldom the high of the\nday. And when the close is at the exact high of the day, that’s useful informa-\ntion. It means people who do hold overnight positions are buying right up to\nthe last minute, offsetting the usual end-of-day sales.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The buyer obviously thought he was getting a bargain or good value and \nCurrent events: Buy on the rumor; sell on the news\nNew highs and lows are often the seed of a new \ntrend, and usually arise directly from a specific \npiece of news. Fresh news that causes a new \nhigh or a new low is an event. The risk that a \nnew high or low will ensue from the news is \nevent risk. It may seem odd, but most events \nare not surprises, but rather scheduled, such as\n ✓ News or a rumor pertaining to the secu-\nrity itself, such as a company’s earnings \nannouncement\n ✓ Market-related events such as options \nexpiration dates or the end of a calendar or \ntax period\n ✓ Scheduled releases (such as the Fed’s \ninterest rate statement or any of a dozen \neconomic reports)\nEvent risk also refers to unexpected \ndevelopments:\n ✓ Acts of terrorism and war.\n ✓ Natural disasters.\n ✓ Correlation of a stock to the performance \nof the major indices. Even if your stock is \ndoing well, for example, it can open down \nfrom the close the night before as a side \neffect of a drop in the index or sector to \nwhich it belongs.\n ✓ Previous technical levels, such as a round \nnumber (like 10,000 on the Dow) or a his-\ntoric high or low (see Chapter 4).\nTraders treat forecasts prepared by economists \nand analysts as though the event had already \nhappened precisely as predicted. In other words, \nthey “build in” the forecast to the price, creating \nthe very high on the price bar that the news is \nsupposed to produce. This practice is named buy \non the rumor, where rumor refers to the forecast.\nThe rest of the phrase is sell on the news. The \nnews is the event itself. You sometimes get the \nseeming paradox of a price reaching a new \nhigh before the event and falling lower imme-\ndiately after the event, even when the news \nmatches the forecast. The lower price comes \nabout because the early birds take profit on \nthe up move that they themselves engineered. \nThe new low is usually short lived. After all, the \nforecast was for good news and the good news \noccurred, so the news was properly built in and \nthe new high is the appropriate price.\nIf the news is much better than forecast, \nthough, traders don’t take profit because \nbetter-than-expected news draws in new play-\ners and sends the price higher still. Then the \nearly birds are positioned to make even better \nprofits. Should the news fail to match expecta-\ntions, traders and investors alike sell, and the \ndip may turn into a longer-lasting price drop. \nEither way, to buy on the rumor pays off for the \nshort-term trader who keeps his finger on the \ntrigger. Evaluating forecasts and being mentally \nready to buy or sell at the moment of impact of \nthe news is a difficult and risky business. It’s \nno wonder risk-averse traders get out of the \nmarket altogether around scheduled event \ndates. Buy on the rumor, sell on the news is a \nprimary cause of technical price developments, \nand in many instances, the only “technical anal-\nysis” that commentators mention (along with \nthe 200-day moving average — see Chapter 12).\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

After a price is established through the execution\n\nof a real cash trade, traders have a baseline from which to track prices. Any\ntransaction may occur at a random price, but not every transaction can occur\nrandomly, or the market in that security would collapse.\n\nThe central observation of technical analysis is that the price bar embodies\nall the supply-demand dynamics of the day and that a series of bars on a chart\nshows the evolution of the supply-demand dynamics over time. Some percent-\nage of the time, the evolution is visible in the form of a trend. In this section, I\ndescribe how to use combinations of bars to help identify a trend.\n\nIdentifying an uptrend\n\nThe textbook-perfect uptrend is a series of up-day price bars (close higher\nthan the close yesterday) that have higher highs and higher lows in a majority\nof the bars:\n\nHigher high: When the high today is higher than the high yesterday or\nhigher than the high of the past few days, you have a higher high. Higher\nhighs refers to visible peaks, not a higher high every single day. A series\nof higher highs often signals that the market is feeling enthusiastic about\nthe security. But you usually don’t know at the time whether a new high\nor a small series of new highs is the beginning of a trend.\n\nHigher low: You need to qualify the higher high as truly indicating that\na trend may be forming. What you want is an additional confirming con-\ndition — you can specify that you must also have higher lows.\n\nNow you have two pieces of evidence that bulls outnumber bears. A series of\nhigher highs together with higher lows hints that a trend is forming. After two\ndays, you aren’t yet sure what is happening, but you're starting to get excited.\nAfter all, your goal in identifying a trend is to buy near the beginning of the\ntrend. As I describe in Chapter 1, your key assumption is that a trend, once\nformed, will continue. If you have two higher highs with two higher lows, can\nyou assume that Day 3 will also deliver a higher high and a higher low?\n\nNot necessarily. Alas, prices don’t move in straight lines. You often see a\nseries of two or three higher highs interrupted by one or two lower highs.\nThis happens for several reasons:\n\nTraders already in the security are taking an early profit.\n\nv The market is reconsidering whether the new high is really justified.\n\nv The higher highs were just a random accident.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n103",

You see a series of days on which the close is higher than the close\nthe day before. At the same time, the price is making a fresh high nearly every\nday, but not every day without fail. See the bar marked “Day 4.” On that day,\nthe close was higher than the open and the low was higher than the day\nbefore, but the high of the day was not higher than the day before. Oh, oh.\nWhat does that mean? Remember, you don’t know yet what Day 5 is going to\nbring at the time you're looking this chart.\n\nMost analysts tell you not to worry about this particular configuration of\nbars. It’s an uptrend, all right, and you know this because you have an unbro-\nken series of higher /ows. Day 4 is a disappointment — it doesn’t deliver a\nhigher high — but the low is higher than all the previous lows. By consider-\ning the additional factor of higher lows, you confirm that the probability is\npretty good of getting a higher high and a higher close on Day 5.\n\nPinpointing a downtrend\n\nA downtrend is a series of down-day bars (a close lower than yesterday) char-\nacterized by lower lows and lower highs in a preponderance of the bars. For\nexample: Look at the down days in Figure 6-3. After the first day, each of these\nbars has a close lower than the close the day before. Day 3 has the same high\nas the day before, but a lower low. On Day 3, you start to get the idea that this\nmay be the beginning of a downtrend.\n\nWhen identifying a downtrend, a series of lower highs is a good confirming\nindicator to the series of lower lows. The same psychology applies as when an\nuptrend starts, only in reverse. Sellers see that new lows are occurring — some-\nbody must know something negative about the security. Traders aren’t willing\nto hold a falling asset, and they unload it at ever-lower prices. Meanwhile, fans\nof the security can’t give it support at yesterday’s low — selling pressure is\ntoo great.\n\nWading through Murky Bar Waters\n\nReading bar charts isn’t always a clear-cut process. In bar terms, a trend has\ntwo identifiers — a series of higher highs (or lower lows) and a series of up\ndays (or down days). (See previous sections in this chapter.) Technical anal-\nysis doesn’t offer a hard-and-fast rule on which identifier is more important.\nTraditional technical analysis emphasizes that you need higher lows to con-\nfirm the higher highs in an uptrend, but candlestick analysis, which I cover\nin Chapter 8, says that the position of the close trumps every other factor,\nincluding a new high or low.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In candlestick analysis, you may accept\nonly one day or none because the trading style associated with candlestick\nanalysis is very short term.\n\nSo how should you approach bar reading to break through the muck? In this\nsection, I suggest sticking to attributing supply-and-demand analysis to the\nhigh and low of the bar.\n\nPaying heed to bar series\n\nMost of the time, a series of higher highs with higher lows or a series of lower\nlows with lower highs does mean that a trend is emerging, even if the close\n\nis not yet in the right position to confirm it. Higher closes are the logical\noutcome of new highs if they persist in a series, just as lower closes are the\noutcome ofa series of lower lows. The mind of the market isn’t hard to read.\nMarket players start wondering why new highs or lows are occurring. They\nknow a new high or a new low can occur only if some trader decides to buy\nor sell there — so what does he know that other traders don’t know?\n\nNew highs and lows arouse emotions in the following ways:\n\nAnew high or low makes market participants nervous. A sufficiently\nlarge number of new highs triggers greed — better buy now so you don’t\nmiss out, even if you don’t know why the new high is occurring. The\nresult is a higher close as buyers pile in near the end of the day.\n\nNew lows scare just enough traders that they sell their positions, even in\nthe absence of any fresh news that would justify it. Sellers are unwilling\nto hold a falling asset and so sell, causing a lower close.\n\nBut sometimes it’s the other way around — you get a series of up days with-\nout getting a series of higher highs. In other words, the close today is higher\nthan the close yesterday, but the high today isn’t higher than the high yester-\nday. Pay attention anyway because new highs may start to appear. These new\nhighs may happen solely because so many people are aware of the meaning of\nup days and down days. In other words, so many people look at technical indi-\ncators — and a series of up days or down days is a basic indicator — that they\nanticipate higher highs or lower lows. By acting on that expectation — buying\nor selling ahead of the actual appearance of a higher high or lower low — they\nmake it happen. You can observe this type of self-fulfilling prophecy often in\ntechnical analysis.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

A downtrend is a series of down-day bars characterized by lower\nlows and lower highs in most of the bars. Your task is to define when a lower\nlow from the day before is relatively harmless and when a higher high is\nrelatively significant. But markets are not neat and tidy, and not every bar is\ngoing to qualify on all three criteria.\n\nSee Figure 6-4. This chart depicts an uptrend — even though not every bar\nqualifies as belonging to an uptrend. You see lower lows as well as several\ndays on which the bar is a down day. Down days are colored black, and up\ndays are gray. This figure demonstrates two points where textbook defini-\ntions of trends are relative.\n\nSIGNIFICANT HIGHER HIGHS\n\nWhat is relatively harmless or significant is a subjective judgment. Try to\nmake the effort to think about what highs and lows are saying about immedi-\nate supply and demand for the security:\n\nSignificance: What is a significant high? You determine the answer to\nthat question. You can judge significance by eyeing the chart, or you can\nspecify rules, such as “a significant high is one that is x percent higher\nthan the average of the past y highs.” You can use software to develop\na “filter” that defines criteria like a “significant high.” In Figure 6-4, two\nsignificant higher highs stand out. They each represent a 50 percent gain\nfrom the previous up day high. Note also that every high is higher than\nthe day before, but every significant high is higher than the highs that\ncame before.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You just need to identify\na preponderance of higher highs and a preponderance of higher lows.\nPreponderance generally means “majority.” For example, a preponder-\nance of higher highs may mean a simple majority, say six of ten bars,\naccompanied by six of ten higher lows. However, determining a prepon-\nderance is your call. Maybe you like seven out of ten. You can eyeball\nit or use software to develop a precise definition and backtest it on\nhistorical data.\n\nay?

You’d \njust be guessing.

It’s the “base case.”\n\nv Embracing daily price bars puts you on the same page with the majority\nof people in the market.\n\nEven people who use intraday data (such as hourly bars) also look at\nthe daily price bars.\n\nTechnical analysis writers are sensitive to the increased use of intraday data,\nand today usually speak of periods rather than days. Changing the vocabulary\nhas the unfortunate effect of making some technical analysis writing sound\nformal or pompous — but it’s more accurate.\n\nZooming out to a higher time frame\n\nYou can display prices in a weekly or monthly format. Mutual fund bars con-\ntaining all the components are available only weekly. Quarterly and annual\ncharts are seen less often. The universality of standard bar notation isn’t\nhard to understand — after all, a week has an opening price (the first trade\non Monday morning) and a closing price (the last trade on Friday afternoon),\nwith a high and a low somewhere in between. The weekly close is a summary\nof the sentiment of the majority of market participants for the week, just as\nthe daily closing price summarizes sentiment for the day.\n\nYou can often see trends and patterns over longer time frames that are hard\nto see on a daily chart. If you're using charting software, make the habit of\ntoggling the chart from a daily time frame to the weekly and monthly time\nframes to see whether anything pops out at you. In addition, you can use, say,\na weekly chart to confirm a new trend that you discover on a daily chart.\n\nZooming in to a shorter time frame\n\nMany traders today track and trade prices on shorter time intervals, like\nthe 60-minute bar.

The\nnotation is the same as in daily bars, though. The opening price is the price\nof the first trade during the period, and the closing price is the last trade\ndone during the period, and so on. You can also see fick bars, a somewhat\nweird way of looking at prices in which a bar is created every 20 or 50 ticks\nno matter how much time it takes.\n\nChoosing an interval\n\nIf you start using intraday price bars, how do you select the interval? Experts\nare reluctant to give advice on this point. Leading data vendor eSignal offers\nstandard intervals of 1, 3, 5, 10, 13, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, as well as daily,\nweekly, monthly, or custom intervals of your choice. (You have to wonder\nwhy users told eSignal they wanted the 13-minute interval.) In foreign\nexchange, you may often see traders use bars covering 240 minutes (four\nhours) or 360 minutes (six hours), a tidy way of keeping track in a 24-hour\nmarket as it travels around the globe.\n\nThe only logical way to select an interval is to treat it like a new pair of jeans.\nTry them all on your favorite security and see how they look. Selecting the\ninterval to use in displaying bars is subjective. Sometimes you may want to\nuse an odd number of minutes (like 13 or 73) because those bars regularly\nshow patterns that give you insights. Remember, bar reading is a visual art.\nOther times you may prefer to look at what everyone else is looking at, on the\nprinciple that following the crowd is usually the right way to forecast.\n\nYou want an interval that accurately represents activity in the security and\nsuits your needs at the same time. If you’re trading an equity that has trad-\ning volume of only 10,000 shares during the day and all of that is done in 5\ntrades, spacing your bars at 3-minute or 15-minute intervals is silly. Your\nresult would be a chart that is mostly blank, and every trade looks like it\ngapped from the one before. (For an explanation of gaps, see Chapter 7.)\n\nIf you’re watching a traditionally heavily traded security, such as IBM,\nthough, you get a complete bar for every l-minute interval, and each bar con-\ntains the open, high, low, and close of that minute. Be careful not to sabotage\nyour analysis by selecting a time frame that’s out of sync with the normal\nflow of trading in the selected security.\n\nThe key to selecting the right interval is the liquidity of the security you're\ntrading. Liquidity refers to potential volume in this context — kind of like a\nbench of buyers waiting around for their chance at bat, meaning a price that\npleases them, with an opposing bench of sellers willing to throw balls until\nsomebody takes a swing.

Being able to identify a few special cases, however, is useful because\nyou see these cases often enough that they serve as signposts to guide your\ninterpretation of what the price is going to do next.\n\n“Special bars” are a small series of two to five bars — called combinations or\nconfigurations — that stand out on a chart.

Over the years, traders have\ninterpreted these special bar combinations in specific ways, which I describe\nin this chapter. Knowing how other traders feel toward specific bar configu-\nrations can help you make your own trading decisions.\n\nAs a general rule, you want to “go with the flow” — trade with the conven-\ntional wisdom about the meaning of the configurations.

The start of a\nnew trend is sometimes the end of an old one, called a reversal. In this sec-\ntion, you can figure out how these price bar combinations give you clues\nabout general market sentiment in order to anticipate your next move.\n\nTick and bar placement\n\nIn Chapter 6, I define an uptrend as a series of bars featuring higher highs\ntogether with higher lows, and a downtrend as a series of lower lows together\nwith lower highs. An uptrend also features bars that have a close higher than\nthe day before — up days. A downtrend contains mostly down days (closes\nlower than the day before). A fourth factor you want to consider is whether\nthe close is above the open (or below the open in the case of a downtrend).\n\nYou hardly ever see a series of bars where every single one of these factors\nconfirms the trend. Because prices never move entirely in a straight line, you\nhave to accept that some bars in a trend don’t fall into line with all the trend\ncriteria. You may have one or two bars in an uptrend that don’t have higher\nhighs or a few bars where the close is lower than the day before. Such varia-\ntions in fick placement (the horizontal line marking the open and close) and\nbar placement (position of a price bar relative to the bars that precede it) are\nnormal in even the best-behaved trend.\n\nSome bars are just a little out of line, but sometimes you see bars that really\nstand out. It takes almost no practice at all to differentiate ordinary out-of-\nline bars from special configurations that traders consider to be associated\nwith specific interpretations.\n\nIn a series of three bars, each having four components, you can get any one\nof 2,463 permutations of configuration. When you specify joint conditions,\nsuch as higher high together with higher low, the number of combinations\nreaches into the millions — and that’s just with three bars! So, when you see\nthe special cases, you know that you've got a valuable clue to upcoming price\nbehavior. This is why, by the way, we can dismiss charges that technical\nanalysis is not “proven” scientifically. The computational power to prove the\nvalidity of any single bar configuration does not yet exist. That doesn’t mean\nthat the majority of human beings do not respond the same way to the same\npatterns on a chart in the year 2020 as in the year 1920.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In\nfact, nobody can tell you even roughly what percentage of the time the stan-\ndard interpretation is correct, because it may be correct all the time in one\nsecurity but only 10 percent of the time in another, or correct 75 percent of\nthe time in one year but only 50 percent in another.\n\nA bar component or even the placement of the entire bar can be random.\nRandom highs and lows, and even a few random bars, are caused by a “greater\nfool” making a trade at a sucker price or a whole batch of traders mistakenly\nbelieving a false rumor. Often you never know the reason for some weird bar\nconfiguration. Some securities have a high number of known configurations,\nand some are prone to out-of-whack (meaningless) configurations. The orderli-\nness and regularity (or lack of regularity) is a function of the crowd that trades\neach security, and should be a consideration when you're choosing what\nsecurities to trade. See Chapter 14 on volatility.\n\nTypes of configurations\n\nJust like patterns (see Chapter 9), when you spot a special small-bar configu-\nration, you're looking for either trend confirmation or a signal that the trend\nis at risk of ending. Here are two types of configurations:\n\nContinuation patterns: The trend is continuing. The direction and pace\nof the trend are about the same as they were before. Relax. The more\nconfirmation you can get, the safer you feel. You see hard evidence\nof the trend continuing, such as a preponderance of higher highs and\nhigher lows marking bullish sentiment on the part of the trading crowd.\n\nReversal patterns: The trend is switching direction. When the trend\nshifts from down to up or up to down, the configuration of the bar com-\nponents and their placement across a series of price bars often shout,\n“The trend is changing!” from the rooftop. Listen up. If you have a posi-\ntion in the security, a reversal pattern tells you to exit. If you hold on to\nthe position anyway, your risk of loss is much higher.\n\nA reversal pattern is not only a warning to exit when you're invested\n\nin the security, it’s also advance notice that a good entry place may be\ncoming up.

The daily trading range is the difference between the \nhigh and the low of the day. You can also say that the range defines the emo-\ntional extremes of the day:\n \n✓ If you have a bar with a small range in a sea of larger bars, the market \nis indecisive. Indecisiveness isn’t the same thing as indifference. \nIndecisiveness can be dangerous — nobody wanted to buy at a higher \nhigh, so perhaps buyers are getting tired of that security at current \nprices. A change in sentiment may be brewing, such as deceleration in a \nprice rise that precedes the end of the trend.\n \n✓ When it’s one very large bar in a sea of smaller ones, pay attention. \nSomething happened. Traders are willing to pay a lot more for a rising \nsecurity, or they want to dump a falling one so badly that they’ll accept \nan abnormally low price.\nNote that if you include gaps, covered later in this chapter, the true range of \na series of small-range bars suddenly gets a lot bigger.\nIdentifying Common Special Bars\nSpecial bars almost always mean the same thing, and in turn you can focus \non a few of the common special bars with confidence in their reliability. In \nthis section, you can get a feel for these common special bars, pictured in \nFigure 7-1, and figure out how to identify them with ease.

You are\ntrying to understand what buyers and sellers might be thinking — which |\ncover in Chapter 6 and in this chapter — so keep it simple. Don’t think that\nyou've found a zebra when you're looking at a horse.\n\nClosing on a high note\n\nIt’s wildly bullish when the price closes at the high over several days. A\nseries of closes at the high — and its downtrending counterpart, closes at\n\nthe low — indicate that the existing trend is likely to continue. In Figure 7-1,\nConfiguration A illustrates closes at the high. The price has closed at the high\nof the day for three days running, and the third bar is much longer than the\nothers, which means the high-low range is wider than the previous two days.\nSo, what’s happening?\n\nThe first two bars show the close at the high at about the same level. On the\nsecond bar, the low of the day was lower than the low the day before, mean-\ning that sellers came out of the woodwork. But the bulls fought back, buying\nmore and more, so that the close was still at the high, trumping the lower\nlow. Day three delivers a whopping gain — and a third close at the high. By\nnow you may be ready to bet the ranch on this configuration.\n\nYour instincts are right, with one caution: A big gain is often followed by profit\ntaking by active traders. Three days isn’t enough to call this configuration a\ntrend, so traders call it a move. It doesn’t matter whether the closes-at-high\noccur at the start of a trend or while the trend is in progress —a fat gain\nalways inspires some traders to take profit. Profit-taking doesn’t change a\ntrend, but can dent performance the next day. You may see a lower high or a\nlower close.\n\nYou can use your imagination (or turn the book upside down) to envision the\nparallel configuration on Configuration A of Figure 7-1 — closes at the low. As\n\nyou may expect, a series of closes at the low imply that a downtrend is form-\ning or worsening.\n\nSpending the day inside\n\nConfiguration B in Figure 7-1 shows the inside day. An inside day refers to a\nprice bar that meets two criteria:\n\nThe high is lower than the previous day’s high.\nThe low is higher than the previous day’s low.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "] 18 Part Ill: Observing Market Behavior\n\nTesting folklore\n\nAn inside day signals that the market is having\nsecond thoughts about a security. Some ana-\nlysts say that an inside day is always a continu-\nation bar. Others, notably candlestick chartists\n(see Chapter 8), see an inside day (named a\nharami) as a warning of a possible trend rever-\nsal. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nNo one can give you a definitive answer.\nTrading Systems Analysis Group (TSAG) exam-\nined the data of 60 equities over four years —\nover 60,000 price bars — and found 2,000\ninstances of inside days. About half the time\nin an existing uptrend, the bar after an inside\nday delivered a higher high (a continuation) and\nabout half the time it didn’t. For existing down-\ntrends, the percentage was the same — about\n\nhalf the time the inside day was followed the\nnext day by a lower low. Actually, there was a\ntendency to continue the existing trend on the\nday after the inside day — a higher high in an\nuptrend and a lower low in a downtrend — but\nit was so small as to be right on the edge of the\nmargin of error.\n\nThe inside day is still useful to signal that sen-\ntiment may be ready to change. Also, keep in\nmind that the TSAG study is limited to the exact\nquestion asked — what happened the next\nday? This doesn't address what happened two\ndays later, or three days. View the inside day\nas a signal alerting you to watch for a break-\nout, however minor, without telling you the\ndirection.\n\nAn inside day is a bar “inside” the previous day’s high-low range. It reflects\nindecision. Buyers didn’t feel strongly enough about this security to buy\nmore. Sellers weren't particularly inspired to sell, either. The inside day\ndoesn’t suggest what’s going to happen the following day. But it does warn\nthat the market is starting to reconsider what it feels about this security.\n\nGetting outside for the day\n\nCheck out Configuration C in Figure 7-1, which is the outside day. On an out-\nside day, the high-low range of the bar is outside the range of the preceding\nbar. The open and close ticks can appear anywhere on the outside day bar,\n\nbut two variations stand out:\n\nThe open is at the low, and the close is at the high. This configuration\nsuggests that something new has happened to inspire bullish buying\nright up to the end of the day.\n\nThe open is at the high, and close is at the low. You can deduce the\nopposite supply-demand setup here. Sentiment turned bearish and sell-\ners overwhelmed buyers, right to the end of the day.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Chapter 7: Reading Special Bar Combinations: Small Patterns ] ] 9g\n\nar Although the size of an outside day bar gets your attention, its appearance\nalone doesn’t tell you much. After considering where the open and close are\nlocated on the bar, take a look at what else is going on in the market, espe-\ncially the configuration of the preceding bars. Here is what you can see:\n\n Notrend exists. The outside day alerts you to a possible trend beginning.\n\nA trend is in place. The outside day may suggest a reversal or a continu-\nation, depending on where the open and close are and which direction\nthe security is trending. The outside day has a higher high by definition,\nbut a higher close as well implies continuation in an uptrend and rever-\nsal in a downtrend, especially if the close is exactly at the high. Similarly,\nthe outside day has a lower low by definition, so it confirms continua-\ntion in a downtrend, especially if the close is at the low.\n\nFinding the close at the open\n\nConfiguration D in Figure 7-1 shows a series of bars where the close is at or\nnear the open. As you can guess, a close at or near the open reflects indeci-\nsion among market participants. Trader opinion is divided as to whether this\nbar generally signifies a continuation or reversal pattern. Consider it a clue to\nlook at what else is going on, such as trading volume.\n\nay? However, in specific instances, the interpretive process gets a bit more\ndefinite: When the open and close are at (or almost at) the same price, and\nthey’re at the high or low of the day, you have a greater chance of determining\nwhether the trend will continue or reverse. Which way the cookie crumbles\ndepends on what was happening before:\n\nIn an uptrend: If the open and close are near the high, look for the\nuptrend to accelerate (continuation with gusto). If they are near the low,\nlook for a reversal.\n\nIna downtrend: If the open and close are near the low, expect more of\nthe same. If they are near the high, think about a reversal.\n\nDecoding Spikes\n\nWhile the inside day and the outside day I depict in Figure 7-1 have high-low\nranges noticeably different from the preceding bars, they don’t make your\nhair stand on end. Sometimes, though, the market delivers an exceptionally\nbig bar with a wildly out-of-whack high or low. Figure 7-2 shows two of these\nuncommon price bars, called spikes.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Do spikes matter? Yes, although sometimes they’re\njust randomly generated by rumors and market silliness.\n\nKEY\nREVERSAL\n\nEXIT AT\nSPIKE LOW\n\nIn some cases, a spike turns out to be an anomaly. The top example in\n\nFigure 7-2 shows such a case. The spike low suggests that some people pan-\nicked and were selling so much and at such a frantic pace that buyers got a\nbargain at abnormally low prices. But panic was misplaced. The next day, the\nprice resumed its uptrend and its same “normal” high-low range. The spike\nwas just an oddity — a random move. Maybe the panicked sellers believed a\nrumor that the buyers didn’t hear or knew was false. Or perhaps the sellers\nwere deliberately trying to break a support line, as I describe in Chapter 10.\n\nThe bottom spike example in Figure 7-2 is, in contrast, an important bar\nnamed a key reversal because on the next few days, the price proceeded to\nmake lower highs and lower lows — this bar marks a trend reversal. Key\nreversals can be ordinary bars and aren’t always spikes, but when you see a\nspike, always ask yourself whether it qualifies as a reversal.\n\nAs the spike is occurring, you don’t know where the low is going to come\nuntil after the bar is completed, and obviously you can’t exit the trade until\nthen (in other words, in the next trading session).

You seldom\nknow whether a spike is random or meaningful on the day that it happens.\nOnly hindsight can tell you that.\n\nThough hindsight has the final say on the meaning of a spike, you can still use\nspikes for the following immediate analytical purposes:\n\nInvestigate the environment. Sometimes you do know when a spike is a\nkey reversal, because you can determine what shock caused it and use\nyour judgment in interpreting that the news or event is sound.\n\nTrust the close. As a general rule, you’re safe assuming that the close is\nthe most important part of the bar because it sums up the sentiment for\nthe day. To see the usefulness of the close, take a look at the two exam-\nples in Figure 7-2:\n\n¢ Continuation spike: In the top chart showing a spike low, the close\nis near the high. The wider high-low range and the lower low are\na worry, to be sure, but the position of the close near the high\ntrumps those worries.\n\n¢ Key reversal day: The bottom chart in Figure 7-2 shows three com-\nponents to worry about — not only the wide high-low range but\nalso the lower low and close near the low.\n\nA key reversal bar is also called a swing bar, although not all swing bars are\nspikes. A swing bar is any bar that is the final and lowest low in a series of lower\nlows or the final and highest high in a series of higher highs, as in the bottom\nchart in Figure 7-2. You can see a spike bar at the end of the day after the close,\nbut you can’t identify it as a swing bar until after two additional closes.\n\nA conservative trading tactic is to order your broker to sell the security if the\nprice falls below the low of the spike day over the next two or three days. This\nmethod is plain old crowd following. Everybody can see the same spike low\nand many will have sell orders at that level, and you should, too. The bar fol-\nlowing a spike is often an inside day. Other times the following bar has a new\nhigher high only a few pennies above the spike high and a close lower than the\nspike bar close. Neither bar is helpful. They’re simply inconclusive, and you\nhave to wait for additional evidence to get guidance on how to trade.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

A gap is a\nmajor, visible discontinuity between two price bars on a chart. Because every\nbar encompasses all the transactions made during a specific period, a gap\nmarks the absence of any transactions at the prices covered by the gap. In this\nsection, I give you pointers to identify gaps and how to use them.\n\nPinpointing a gap\n\nThe gap is a void — no supply is offered at the prices the gap encompasses.\nCheck out the gap in Figure 7-3. Prices had to shift upward in order for supply\nand demand to meet again and for both buyers and sellers to be satisfied. On\ndaily charts, you can often see an opening gap when the opening price today\ndiverges dramatically from yesterday’s high or low, although you can also\nsee gaps between bars on intraday charts.\n\nYou can identify a gap at the open of the bar but you can’t measure a gap\nuntil the day’s trading is over. Then you measure it from yesterday’s high to\ntoday’s low (for an upside gap) or from yesterday’s low to today’s high (for\n\na downside gap). The gap is between the bars, not between the opens and\ncloses. If the security opens on a gap but then the gap is filled during the day,\nthe gap doesn’t show up on a daily chart.

    "text": "123\n Chapter 7: Reading Special Bar Combinations: Small Patterns\nGaps are usually triggered by news, like earnings or some other event, \nwhether true or invented (rumors). Events are the source of most key price \nmoves, especially gaps. Prices don’t, on the whole, move randomly — traders \nhave reasons, right or wrong, to buy and sell. Even the strongest trend can be \nbroken by a piece of fresh news contrary to the trend direction. Authentically \nbig news trumps the chart (nearly) every time.\nThat’s why gaps are such a valuable pattern — you know instantly how the \nmarket is interpreting the news. The reason to read bars is to get an accurate \nassessment of whether news is big or merely ordinary. Some news is easy \nto interpret. News will start a new uptrend if it’s wildly favorable or halt an \nuptrend dead in its tracks if it’s wildly unfavorable. But much of the time, you \ndon’t know how to interpret news — and there is so much news! — until you \nsee how the market treats it in the form of the bar on the chart. Traders often \nget the bit between their teeth on news and this is especially clear with gaps.\nConsider how a gap develops. Say that Blue Widget stock closes on Monday \nat $15 per share. After the closing bell, it announces bad news — the book-\nkeeper embezzled several million dollars and ran off to Rio. (You’ve probably \nnoticed how companies always wait, if they can, until after the market closes to \ndeliver bad news. Presumably they hope that what looks just awful at 5 p.m. \nwon’t look so bad the next morning.) However, in this case, the market is \nunforgiving and the next day, Blue Widget opens gap down at $10. Most \npeople deduce that the opening gap down implies further price drops, and \nthey proceed to sell — in droves.\nThe total gap for the day may not be $5, though. During the course of the \nday, Blue Widget may trade as high as $12, making the net gap a $3 gap. If the \nprice of Blue Widget normally trades in a $2 high-low range, $3 is still a sig-\nnificant number — 50 percent higher than normal. Gaps are significant when \nthey’re proportionally large compared to the trading range (see the “Kicking \nthings off: Breakaway gaps” section in this chapter).\nGaps occur with good news, too. If Blue Widget announces a fabulous new \ndiscovery, the opening price on the following day may be a gap up, like the \none in Figure 7-3. You may deduce from this gap that some traders (including \nwell-paid professional analysts) had a whole night to evaluate the news, and \nthey bought the stock at the open, so you should buy it, too. The gap implies \nbuyers anticipate the stock rising throughout the day from the opening price, \nand you want to jump (if not leap) on this bandwagon.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "] 2 4 Part Ill: Observing Market Behavior\n\nUsing primary gaps to your advantage\n\nGaps are, indeed, a wonderful trading opportunity if you can differentiate\nbetween a common gap and uncommon gaps. In the following sections, I\ndescribe the main types of gaps and how to use them.\n\nLacking opportunity: Common gaps\n\nA common gap is one that appears out of nowhere for no particular reason\n(no fresh news). Common gaps can occur in trending and nontrending prices.\nIf the price is trending, it fails to change the trend. If the price isn’t trending,\nit fails to initiate a trend. Common gaps are generally insignificant.\n\nWhat causes a common gap? Simple error. Common gaps often occur when\nliquidity is low, meaning few players are in the market. Some trader sees a\nprice offered that’s a gap away from the last price posted and decides to buy.\nThe offer may have been a mistake, too, or the offering trader could be trying\nto break a trendline or have some other hidden agenda. But because the\nmarket doesn’t have many participants and the fresh news is minor, if there’s\nany at all, the effort fizzles.\n\nA common gap tends to have low volume on the gap day. To judge an opening\ngap, consult volume. If volume is low or normal, traders aren’t jumping on the\nbandwagon, and it’s probably a common gap. If volume is abnormally high,\ntraders are jumping on the bandwagon, and the gap will probably lead to a big\nrise or fall in the coming days.\n\nA security that normally has low volume tends to have more gaps than heavily\ntraded securities. A low-volume security is described as thinly traded, meaning\nfew market participants. Don’t try to interpret gaps in thinly traded securities.\nThese gaps are usually just common gaps and mean nothing at all.\n\nKicking things off: Breakaway gaps\n\nA breakaway gap is an important event because it almost always marks the\nstart of a new trend. Not only do you get the gap and a new trend, but you also\nget a major change in the appearance of the chart, such as a widening of the\nnormal high-low daily trading range, an increase in day-to-day volatility, and\nmuch higher volume. All these changes occur because the breakaway gaps\ndraw in new traders. A breakaway gap is event driven, usually on some news\nabout the security itself. Figure 7-4 illustrates a breakaway gap.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Fresh news creates\nnew supply-and-demand conditions and ignites a trend.\n\nYou interpret a breakaway gap depending on whether it’s upward or down-\nward, according to supply and demand, in the following way:\n\nUpside breakaway gap: Good news creates demand. New buyers want\nto own the security and are willing to pay ever-higher prices to get it.\nVolume is noticeably higher than usual.\n\nDownside breakaway gap: Traders can’t wait to get rid of their holdings\nand accept ever-lower prices to achieve that goal. Volume may or may\nnot be abnormally high.\n\nContinuing the push: Runaway gaps\n\nA runaway gap occurs after a security is already moving in a trended way and\nfresh news comes out that promotes the existing trend. See the second gap\nin Figure 7-4. What's the difference between a breakaway gap and a runaway\ngap? A breakaway gap starts a trend. A runaway gap continues a trend.

A falling price after a dramatic move up is called a pull-\nback. The security stops making new higher highs and may make some lower\nlows, but doesn’t go as far as the low on the breakaway day. A pullback after\na dramatic price move represents profit-taking by the early birds and is very\ncommon. In fact, professionals count on the pullback to “buy on the dip.” If\nthey get really enthusiastic, reentering professional traders often supply the\nenergy for a runaway gap that follows a breakaway gap.\n\nCalling it quits: Exhaustion gaps\n\nExhaustion gaps occur at the end of a trend, signaling that the party’s over.\nVolume is usually low. What’s exhausted is the news that propelled the secu-\nrity up in the first place and the energy of the early buyers. An exhaustion\ngap is usually followed by a reversal.\n\nHere’s how it works. This example is an exhaustion gap at the end of an\nuptrend, but the mechanics are similar for a downtrend exhaustion gap as\nwell. When you see a gap up in an existing uptrend and volume is low on that\nday, you have to wonder why the gap appeared. Volume tells you that buyers\naren’t pounding on the sellers’ doors to get the security.\n\nPresumably some greedy seller is out there, along with one last fool who’s\nwilling to pay a gap-worth more than the last trade. The buying frenzy is\nover, but the buyer doesn’t realize it. He fails to see that there are a lot of\noffers and few bids. In short, everybody who wanted to buy has already done\nso. But somebody has to be the last buyer, and this particular one got taken\nto the cleaners — in the form of the gap. When he turns around and tries to\nunload his recent purchase, he finds no buyers, at least no buyers at a profit\nto him, and has to dump the security at a loss.\n\nYou can distinguish an exhaustion gap from a runaway gap by looking at\nvolume, which is usually low at an exhaustion gap. Anytime you see wild new\nhighs (or lows) that aren’t accompanied by wild new high volume, be suspi-\ncious of the staying power of the move. You can exit altogether or move up\nyour stop-loss order.\n\nScoring big: Island reversals\n\nSometimes an exhaustion gap is followed immediately by a breakaway gap\ngoing in the other direction (see previous sections for details on exhaustion\nand breakaway gaps).

It looks like an island in a sea of price bars and is\nalmost always an unusually long bar — a wide high-low range.\n\nTake a look at Figure 7-5. You see a series of higher highs, including a minor\ngap up, but then the last buyers realize that they are all alone on top of the\nmountain. They start to sell in a panic and are willing to accept a much lower\nprice. Now the price takes off in the opposite direction on a breakaway gap.\nRemember, a breakaway gap tends to have high volume.\n\nWatching volume can get a little tricky. The island reversal bar has a higher\nhigh but is accompanied by low volume. This combination is the warning. The\nnext day, as the breakaway gap develops, it has unusually high volume. High\nvolume in combination with the downward gap is an indication that early sell-\ning is strong and prices later in the day aren’t going to go back and fill that gap.\n\nNow consider this case in reverse order. Everyone and his brother has been\ndumping the security, and it’s been gapping downward as it trends down-\nward. This time the frenzy is a selling frenzy. At some point, Trader Bruce\nrealizes that the selling has gone on long enough and maybe the price is now\ntoo low — a bargain. Trader Jane agrees and buys it from him, and offers it\non in the market at a gapping price — and wins. Turn Figure 7-5 upside down\nand you can see how an island reversal at the bottom looks.\n\nGAP DOWN\n\nas\nFigure 7-5:\nIsland\nreversal.\nEs\n\nar\n\nExamine price bars, and you can see a lot of gaps.

Stop and think about\nit: When the fundamentals of a security change dramatically, why would\nmarket participants sell it back down to the level it was before the big event?\nConditions have changed permanently and so has the price of the security. If\na company has invented some new must-have product, the new higher stock\nprices may not be the right price, but the old prices based on the old condi-\ntions aren’t right either.\n\nA runaway gap or common gap is another matter. Demand for the stock is\nnormal and not under the influence of news or changing conditions, so the\ngap may be filled by bargain hunters. Sometimes a gap gets filled because the\nchatter about “filling the gap” makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nHow do you know whether a gap will be filled? If it’s a breakaway gap, it proba-\nbly won't be filled, at least not in the near future. If it’s a common or runaway\ngap, it might get filled or it might not. You need to look at other indicators\n(such as momentum in Chapter 13 to confirm whether a price move is at risk\nof going backward to fill a gap).\n\nUsing the Trading Range to Deal\nwith Change Effectively\n\nPas\n\nThe length of the price bar, the trading range, plays a role in the special bar\nconfigurations, spikes, and gaps I discuss in this chapter. But the trading\nrange has meaning in its own right, which you can discover here. As I define\nin the “Trading range” section earlier in this chapter, the trading range is the\ndifference between the high and the low. It measures the maximum distance\nthat the price traveled that period. If you see a security that has been aver-\naging a $3 high-low range and suddenly it starts trading consistently in a $5\nrange, something happened — no matter where the opens and closes are.\n\nPaying attention to a changing range\n\nMarket prices are seldom boring. Events unfold, information leaks, and sto-\nries break. When conditions change, the average trading range is sometimes\nthe first aspect of price behavior to change.\n\nAchange in the high-low range, which you can see in Figure 7-7, usually precedes\n\nor accompanies a change in the direction or slope of a trend.

But a higher close can offset some of the negative senti-\nment inherent in a contracting range.\n\n¢ Contracting range, lower closes: This combination is doubly nega-\ntive. Traders may not be causing lower lows, but they are unload-\ning at or near the close, forcing it lower. Range contraction usually\nmeans that activity is drying up and volume is low — so if you see\nhigh volume and a lower close in a contracting range, you prob-\nably want to get out of Dodge (exit the security).\n\nLooking at the average trading range\n\nThe trading range is a valuable analytical tool. But you want to capture a\nchange in the range in some more-efficient way than eyeballing a bunch of\nbars and trying to figure out whether they're getting bigger or smaller. You\ncan calculate the average high-low range on a piece of paper, a spreadsheet,\nor by using charting software.\n\nThe average trading range is the average distance between the high and the\nlow over a specified period of time. You know what an average is — you mea-\nsure ten of something, add up the measurements, and divide by ten. If you\nhave ten days’ worth of high-low ranges that add up to 32, you know that the\naverage daily trading range for the ten-day period was $3.20.\n\nThe average trading range is one of the best tools you have for keeping your\nsanity and perspective. If you know that the average daily trading range is\n$3.20, the most you can expect to make on this security in a single day is\n$3.20, and that’s assuming that you could buy at the exact low and sell at the\nexact high — and assuming that it’s an average day.\n\nWhen your broker, your brother-in-law, or an e-mail solicitation says you can\nmake $500 in the next month in a specific security, you know that it’s hardly\nlikely.

Under normal, aver-\nage conditions, you can expect the average trading range to persist.\nIn practice, forecasts of abnormally big gains are usually based on forecasts \nof a breakout and the expectations that the breakout will incorporate a gap \non the expected fabulous news. So, how do you incorporate gaps into aver-\nage range analysis? Keep reading the following sections.\nChecking out the gaps\nWhether you’re evaluating a potential gap-making event or just looking at \nranges for clues to market sentiment, you need guidance on how to take \ngaps into account. In the earlier forecasting a $500 gain in a month example, \nit would take more than one gap to deliver this outcome. Gaps almost never \ncome in multiples. In other words, the trader promising this type of gain is in \nthe grip of a delusion — don’t join him there!\nIn regular bar work, say that you are merrily averaging your daily high-low \nranges and suddenly you have a gap. You need to account for that gap or you \nwill be literally missing something. Figure 7-8 displays the problem. On Day 1, \nthe high-low range is $2. The next day, the price opens gap up, but the daily \nrange is the same $2. Therefore, the average range for the two days is also $2. \nLooking at the average range alone, without inspecting every bar and every \nspace on the chart, you wouldn’t know that the gap occurred. Well, so what? \nMaybe the gap is just a common old gap that doesn’t mean anything (see the \n“Lacking opportunity: Common gaps” section in this chapter). If it were an \nimportant gap, like a breakaway gap (see the “Kicking things off: Breakaway \ngaps” section in this chapter), you’d see the range expanding (plus a rise in \nvolume), and the whole issue would be moot, right?\nThe reason you need to account for the gap is that it often precedes a longer-\nterm change in the range, which is what you’re looking for. If you measure \neach day separately and average those numbers, the range looks the same \nfrom day to day. For the first two days in Figure 7-8, though, the range is actu-\nally from the low on Day 1 at $1 to the high on Day 2 at $7 — or a $6 range. \nIn short, the range doubled but the averaging process doesn’t capture this \nchange. In fact, if the range on Day 2 had been smaller, say $1.50, the average \nwould be less than $2. Just looking at the average range on a numerical basis, \nyou would think that the range had contracted — exactly the opposite of \nwhat really happened.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Why \nnot use Day 1’s high rather than the close? Aren’t you double-counting by \nincluding the space between the high and the close from Day 1? No, because \nin range work you don’t really care about the gap itself — you care about the \ntotal range of prices today.

Today you can buy software that identify\ncandlesticks by name and give guidance on interpreting them.\n\nIn this chapter, I break down the components of a candlestick and explain\nwhy candlesticks are so useful. Note that in some instances, a stand-alone\ncandlestick is a “pattern” in its own right, and such candlesticks always have\na name. (For more on patterns, check out Chapter 9.) Named candlesticks\nand small series of candlestick patterns number in the dozens, and I can’t\ncover all of them in this chapter. I select a few candlesticks and combinations\nthat stand out. If candlestick charting appeals to you, check out Candlestick\nCharting For Dummies by Russell Rhoads (Wiley).\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You can quickly and easily figure out \nhow to identify a handful of the top candlestick patterns. Here are some of \nthe advantages you can expect:\n \n✓ Many candlesticks are simple to use and interpret, making it a splendid \nplace for a beginner to start figuring out bar analysis — as well as for old \nhands to achieve new insights. Your eye adapts almost immediately to \nthe information in the bar notation.\n \n✓ Candlesticks and candlestick patterns have delightfully descriptive and \nmemorable names — charming and sometimes alarming — that contain \nthe seeds of interpretation. The names help you remember what the \npattern means. Among the colorful names are “abandoned baby,” “dark \ncloud cover,” and “spinning top.”\n \n✓ Candlestick bar patterns and their interpretation are widely known, so \nyou can expect other participants in the market to respond in a specific \nway to specific patterns.\n \n✓ You can use candlesticks on any chart, with any other indicators, just \nlike standard bars.\n \n✓ Candlestick shapes can be dramatic, so they can often bring your atten-\ntion to a trend change earlier than standard bars do. As I describe in \nChapter 7, some exceptional bar patterns embody a forecast that’s \nusually correct, such as the breakaway gap and the island reversal. \nStandard bar analysis offers very few such patterns, but candlestick \nanalysis offers dozens.\n \n✓ Candlestick patterns excel in identifying strategic market turning points — \nreversals from an uptrend to a downtrend or a downtrend to an uptrend.\nDissecting the Anatomy of a Candlestick\nReady to dive into the components of the candlestick? The first thing you \nnotice is that the candlestick form emphasizes the open and the close. See \nFigure 8-1, the open and the close mark at the top and bottom of the box, \nnamed the real body. A thin vertical line at the top and bottom of the real \nbody, named the shadow, shows the high and the low. (See Chapter 6 for a \ndiscussion of the basic bar components — open, close, high, and low.)\nI present some more details on the candlestick bar components in the \nfollowing sections.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The\ncolor of the real body tells you how the daily struggle between the bulls and\nthe bears played out. Here’s what the colors mean:\n\nv White real body: The close is higher than the open. A white body is bull-\nish, and the longer the body, the more bullish it is. A long candlestick\nindicates that the close was far above the open, implying aggressive\nbuying. In the daily battle of bulls and bears, the bulls won.\n\nBlack real body: The close is lower than the open. A black body is bear-\nish, and the longer the body, the more bearish it is. A long black candle-\nstick indicates a preponderance of sellers throughout the session. In the\ndaily battle of bulls and bears, the bears won.\n\nThe two candlestick bars in Figure 8-1 show the identical open and close, but\ncoloring one of them black creates the optical illusion that it is bigger. That\nblack bar demands your attention, which is one reason candlestick charting\nis appealing — and effective. (For more appealing aspects, see the section\n“Appreciating the Candlestick Advantage” in this chapter.)\n\nDon’t confuse candlestick charting with standard bar notation when it comes\nto color interpretation. In standard bar notation, which I discuss in Chapter 6,\na bar is colored to denote an up day if the close is higher than the close the\nday before. A down day is when the close is lower than the day before. In\ncandlestick notation, only today’s open and today’s close, without reference\nto yesterday’s prices, determines the color of the bar.\n\nAs in all bar analyses, context is crucial. Although you may sometimes use a\nsingle candlestick bar as an indicator in its own right, most of the time you use\nit in relation to the bars that precede it. One small white-body bar in a sea of\nblack bars, for example, may mean the bulls won that day, but it was a minor\nevent. The one white bar may signal that the bears are losing power, but you\nwouldn’t use it all by itself to call the end of a black-bar downtrend.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

See\nFigure 8-2 for three types of dojis. On its own, a doji doesn’t tell you much\nabout market sentiment. You interpret a doji bar in the context of the pattern\nof the preceding bars. A doji implies that sentiment is in a transitional phase.\nIt’s a neutral bar, neither bullish nor bearish, that gains meaning from its\nplacement within a set of bars.\n\nWhen you see a doji after a prolonged uptrend, the doji may mean that the\nbuyers are coming to the end of their bullish enthusiasm. (In Chapter 7, I dis-\ncuss that when the close is at or near the open, market participants are inde-\ncisive.) A doji coming immediately after a very long white bar in an uptrend\nshows that the market is tired. This particular doji is named a bearish doji\nstar. A bullish doji star is a mirror image — it comes after a big black bar ina\ndowntrend. In other cases, it signals an impending reversal.\n\nThe doji form contains important information, regardless of the shadows,\nalthough shadows have their own additional meaning and are covered in a\nlater section. Always take notice of a doji or series of dojis after a trend has\nbeen in place for a while. It’s a transitional bar and you should always be on\nthe lookout for any transition that can affect your trade.\n\ntJ\n\nPLAIN DOJI DRAGONFLY DOJI GRAVESTONE DOJI\n\nCatching the shadow\n\nThe high and the low prices are shown in the shadows, which you can think\nof as a candlewick (on the top) or a tail (on the bottom). Although the\nshadow is secondary to the real body in importance, shadows contribute\nuseful information about market psychology, too, and modify your interpreta-\ntion of the body. Shadows offer special interpretive clues in three instances:\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

However, the two most useful types of doji bars, \nalso shown in Figure 8-2, are the following:\n \n✓ Dragonfly doji: Look for the long, lower shadow that means the open, \nhigh, and close were the same or nearly the same. Sellers were trying to \npush the price down and succeeded in making a low — but they didn’t \nsucceed in getting it to close there. Because the close was back up at or \nnear the open, buyers must have emerged before the end of trading and \nbought enough to move the close to the high or nearly to the high.\n \n How you interpret the dragonfly depends on what bar patterns precede \nit. Your options include the following:\n \n• If the price move is a downtrend, the dragonfly may mean that \nbuyers are emerging and the downtrend may be ending.\n \n• If the dragonfly appears after a series of uptrending bars, buyers \nfailed to push the price over the open to a new high while sellers \nsucceeded in getting a low, so the uptrend may be in trouble.\n \n✓ Gravestone doji: Take a look at that long upper shadow in Figure 8-2. \nThis bar, the exact opposite of the dragonfly, is formed when the open, \nlow, and close are the same or nearly the same, but a high creates a long \nupper shadow. Although buyers succeeded in pushing the price to a \nhigh over the open, by the end of the day the bears were fighting back \nand pushed the price back to close near the open and the low. This push \nis a failed effort at a rally, but you can interpret the bar best in the con-\ntext of the other bars that precede it:\n \n• If the gravestone bar appears after a series of uptrending bars, \nbuyers failed to get the close at the high. Sellers dominated and \nthe uptrend is at risk of ending.\n \n• If the price move is a downtrend, the gravestone doji may mean \nthat buyers are emerging and the downtrend may be ending.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

To get a shaven top or bottom, the open or close must be exactly at\nthe high or the low, as you can see in Figure 8-3. These candlestick bar nota-\ntions are called marubozu candles, and you can classify the types of candles\nby using the following descriptions:\n\nCe\nFigure 8-3:\nMissing\n\nshadows. SHAVEN TOP SHAVEN BOTTOM\n\n Shaven top: No upper shadow exists when the open or close is at the\nhigh. A shaven top can be black or white, and come about in two ways:\n\ne If the open is at the high, the day’s trading was all downhill from\nthere. Not only is it a black candlestick, bearish to begin with, but\nit’s also doubly bearish that no net new buying occurred after the\nopen.\n\ne If the close is at the high, the net of the day’s trading was at higher\nprices, which is bullish. The candlestick is also (by definition)\nwhite —a bullish sign.\n\n Shaven bottom: No lower shadow exists when the open or the close is\nat the low of the day. A shaven bottom can come in two ways:\n\ne If the open is at the low, bulls dominated all the day’s trading.\n\ne If the close is at the low, all the day’s trading points to bearish\nsentiment.\n\nReally long shadows\n\nWhen the shadow is as long as the real body, or longer (see Figure 8-4), trad-\ners are expressing a sentiment extreme. They may or may not follow through\nthe next day by pushing the close to the high or low breaking point, though.\nEvaluating a long shadow can therefore be tricky.\n\nae\nAs a general rule, judge a long shadow by its placement on the chart (relative\nto preceding bars), such as the following:\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

And a change in the size of the\nbar is one of the best indicators of this. The candlestick technique sensitizes\nyou to spot extremes of emotion, which is why it is a valuable tool for mark-\ning possible support and resistance at overbought or oversold levels (which I\ndiscuss in Chapter 2). You can also easily spot range expansion or contraction\n(see Chapter 7).\n\nFor example, at the beginning of the “Dissecting the Anatomy of a\nCandlestick” section, I discuss the idea that the longer the bar, the more\nbullish or bearish it is. If you’re looking at a series of medium-sized bars and\nsuddenly see one relatively long bar (as you can see in Figure 8-5), it may be\ntelling you that support or resistance has been reached. Support marks an\nextreme level where buyers perceive that the price is relatively cheap, and\nresistance marks an extreme level where sellers perceive that the price is\nrelatively high, inspiring profit-taking or least an end to accumulation. (See\nChapter 10 for all the details.)\n\nIn the top illustration in Figure 8-5, you see a series of three white bars\nmaking higher opens and higher closes, followed by a doji and an excep-\ntionally long white bar.

But to interpret the white bar as an \nending burst in an uptrend is more subtle. In fact, an expert in reading stan-\ndard bars would see the same thing. Candlesticks just make it easier, espe-\ncially for traders just starting our or who prefer simplicity.\nIdentifying Special “Emotional Extreme” \nCandlestick Patterns\nDozens of possible bar placement combinations and permutations are pos-\nsible. In this section, I cover several of the most popular patterns and how \nyou can tell the difference between them. These special “emotional extreme” \ncandlestick patterns are unique to candlestick analysis and do not appear in \nthe standard bar pattern analysis I discuss in Chapter 9.\nInterpreting candlestick patterns\nTwo similar candlesticks or candlestick patterns often have the exact oppo-\nsite interpretation, depending on where they fall in a series. You have to \nmemorize the exact patterns to avoid getting confused. I selected just two of \nthe many candlestick patterns to illustrate how tricky some candlestick inter-\npretation can get.\nHammer and hanging man\nBoth of these candlestick types have a small real body and only one shadow — a \nlong lower shadow. While similar, noticing their differences is crucial to your \ninterpretation. The long shadow of the hammer extends to the downside off a \nwhite body, while the long shadow of the hanging man extends to the down-\nside off a body that is either black or white. See Figure 8-6 for an exact image. \nHow can it be a hanging man if the body is white? You can tell from the place-\nment among the rising and then falling bars on either side.\nYou’d think that the white-body version would automatically be a bullish \nindicator and the black-body version a bearish one, but interpreting this can-\ndlestick depends on its placement on the chart, regardless of the real-body \ncolor. If the candlestick appears in a downtrend, for example, it marks the \nlikely end of the trend even if the real body is white.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In this context, the\nlong lower shadow means the sellers were able to achieve a new low, but\nbuyers emerged at some point during the day and the close was higher than\nthe open, indicating last-minute buying.\n\nThe hanging man looks the same except it usually has a black body coming\nafter a series of white uptrending bars. The long lower shadow marks the\nbulls’ failure to prevent the bears making a new low and also from keeping\nthe close below the open. You may see this bar in other places within a series\nof bars, but when you see it at the top of an uptrending series, consider that\nthe trend is probably over. The wise course is to take your profit and run.\n\nHarami\n\nA small real-body candlestick that comes after a bigger one is called a harami,\nwhich means pregnant in Japanese. A harami (see Figure 8-7) implies that a\nchange in sentiment is impending. Technically, the harami pattern requires\ntwo bars, so it doesn’t stand alone. On this chart, | show the shadows of the\nharami bar as also inside the scope of the first big bar, although this isn’t\nessential to identifying the pattern.\n\nA harami can be white or black, and in fact, it can even be a doji. The smaller\n\nthe real body, the more powerful the implication that a reversal is impending.\nIn Figure 8-7, the white bars are seemingly downtrending — already a confus-\ning combination.

Both the exceptionally small harami and the excep-\ntionally big bar preceding it express extreme emotion. The big bar means\n\na bullish “let’s-buy” emotion. Seeing just the big white bar after a series of\nsmaller ones that are downtrending, you may think that the bulls finally got\nthe upper hand, and this movement is the start of an uptrend — especially\nbecause you have an indecision doji just ahead of it. But then the small black\nharami following the big white bar should disillusion you. If an uptrend was\nforming, the harami just put the kibosh on it.\n\nTurning to reversal patterns\n\nReversal patterns number at least 40, and identifying reversals is the main\napplication of candlesticks. The following are some of the most popular and\neasily identified candlestick reversal patterns.\n\nBearish engulfing candlestick\n\nAn engulfing pattern signals the reversal of a trend. The word engulfing refers\nto the open and close of the bar encompassing a wider range than the open\nand close of the day before. In Figure 8-8, the engulfing nature is the domi-\nnant characteristic so that the lower close pops out at you even though the\nbar also has a higher open. When a bar starts out at a higher open but then\ncloses at a lower level, the bears won that day. Not shown in Figure 8-8 is a\nbullish engulfing candlestick, which is white. The higher close is visually com-\npelling because the real body is so big. Like the harami, the engulfing candle-\nsticks require two bars.\n\nShooting star\n\nYou can characterize the shooting star pattern by a small real body and a long\nupper shadow, as you can see in Figure 8-8.

In this occasion, the doji wasn’t \na reversal indicator, at least not for the next day. After the two white candles \ncomes a bearish engulfing candle, a reversal warning that this up move may \nbe ending. The engulfing candle alerts you to watch the next day’s activity, \nespecially the open, with an eagle eye.\nYou can also use candlesticks to confirm relative strength, momentum, and \nmany other indicators. Check out Chapter 13 for details on relative strength \nand momentum. Note that in Japan, a favorite indicator to use with candle-\nsticks is the moving average, which I cover in Chapter 12.\nSome traders use specific candlesticks to identify set-ups, or a pattern config-\nuration that is believed to have a high probability of delivering a specific out-\ncome. Say that after a long series of falling bars, you see a doji bar (indicating \nindecisiveness) or a harami that closes near the upper end of the previous \ncandle — and then a bullish engulfing candlestick. At the same time, another \nindicator like the stochastic oscillator or relative strength index shows the \nsecurity to be deeply oversold. This scenario is a high-probability trade set-\nup, which means to get out the big guns because you want to buy! You can \nfind many resources out there, including in print and online, for great ways \nto combine candlesticks with other indicators. I recommend books and Web \nwork by John Person (pivot points and candlesticks) and Stephen Bigalow.\nTrading on Candlesticks Alone\nReading candlesticks is like reading standard bars — endlessly fascinating, \neven addictive. But be aware that all bar reading takes practice. Some spe-\ncific bars and patterns of bars are well known — and thus likely to get the \nexpected response from market participants. But to do a good job interpret-\ning candlesticks, you need to understand the dynamic and complex relation-\nships of many patterns all at once, like juggling six oranges rather than three.\nAs with standard bar interpretation, the predictive power of a particular bar \nor pattern of bars may be limited to the next day or next few days. If you’re \na swing trader, candlesticks are going to be of more interest to you than if \nyou’re a position trader with a very long holding period (weeks and months).\nLike all technical indicators, candlesticks work only some of the time to \ndeliver the expected outcome. Evaluating candlesticks alone, without con-\nfirmation from other indicators, is a daunting task. First, you have to define, \ncarefully, what each candlestick looks like. As noted in the section “Harami” \nin this chapter, a harami (for example) can be bullish or bearish, depending \non the other bars around it.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "152\nPart III: Observing Market Behavior \nTom Bulkowski took on the task of measuring the predictive value of candle-\nsticks in his book Encyclopedia of Candlestick Charts (published by Wiley). \nCarefully defining each candlestick and set of candlestick patterns for a total \nof 103, Bulkowski ran them through a gigantic database of 500 U.S. equities \nover ten years and found that 69 percent of the candles delivered the outcome \nexpected, such as continuing higher closes following “three white soldiers.” \nBulkowski tested 412 combinations of the 103 candlestick patterns and found \nthat only 100 candles or patterns got the expected outcome, or 24 percent.\nWait — it gets worse. In statistics, you need a bare minimum of 30 to 40 \ninstances of a pattern occurring to see whether it delivers the expected out-\ncome. But Bulkowski found that patterns meeting his definitions didn’t occur \nall that often. In fact, only 10 percent were found a sufficient number of times \nto “qualify” for workability testing. In short, you find only 10 percent of the can-\ndles in sufficient number, and these candles work as expected only 60 percent \nof the time. Refining the criteria further to a 66 percent success rate, meaning \nthat the candle works as advertised in two out of three trades, only 6 percent \nof candles (or 13 candles total) are what Bulkowski calls “investment grade.” \nThese candles include some that I describe in this chapter, including the bear-\nish doji star, bearish engulfing candle, and rising and falling windows.\nBulkowski’s findings don’t mean that you cannot find a specific candlestick \nthat works (say) most of the time in your security. A higher incidence of \nsuccess in candle-reading may be due to other traders in the same security \nseeing the same candlestick pattern and believing it will work — and so it \ndoes. In foreign exchange trading, for example, the hammer, shooting star, \nand engulfing bull or engulfing bear candles work nearly all the time.\nA qualification of the Bulkowski study is that it was applied to U.S. equities, \nnot commodities or other securities, and over a specific ten-year period. Still, \nthe study confirms what you already knew — no technical indicator works all \nthe time. That doesn’t mean specific candlesticks won’t work for you, espe-\ncially if you add confirming indicators like the MACD. This only emphasizes \nonce again that chart-reading is an art.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Before\nthat point is reached, the price must pierce one of the trendlines simply in the\ncourse of trading in its normal range. Which one? Because most of the bars are\ntrending downward, you imagine the odds favor a break to the downside.\n\nBREAKOUT\n\nTRIANGLE\n\nAnd you're right. In the Bulkowski study of triangles, covering 500 stocks\nfrom 1991 to 1996, the symmetrical triangle pattern appeared 146 times. On\n83 occasions, or 57 percent of the time, it was a downside breakout. The aver-\nage decline was 19 percent, and the average decline lasted 74 days. In these\ncases, the triangle was a continuation pattern (see later section, “Cozying Up\nto Continuation Patterns,” in this chapter).\n\nBut sometimes the breakout is to the upside. In the same study, the price\ndelivered an upside breakout 63 times out of 146, or 43 percent of the cases.\nThe average rise was 41 percent and lasted an average of 163 days. In this\ninstance, the pattern forecast a reversal, not a continuation. Most patterns\ndon’t deliver a gift-wrapped buy/sell signal until near the end of the forma-\ntion. As the symmetrical triangle pattern develops, the forecast is only that a\nbreakout will occur, not the direction of the breakout.\n\nYou usually see a burst of higher volume when a pattern reaches comple-\ntion. This observation makes sense — other chartists in the crowd are seeing\nthe same pattern. For triangles, low volume often precedes the breakout, and\nserves as a bonus warning of an impending move.\n\nColoring inside the lines\n\nPattern identification doesn’t require that each single price in a series line up\nperfectly. Not every price high hits an overhead resistance line, for example.\nIt suffices that several hit the line. All triangles — symmetrical, ascending, and\ndescending — incorporate support (top) and resistance (bottom) lines, as do\nflags and pennants, and other patterns. Opinion differs on whether the top\nand bottom lines must enclose every part of every price bar, or if it’s okay for\nthe bar to break the line by a tiny amount as a triangle pattern is developing.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "158 PartIV:Finding Patterns\n\nBER\n\nGenerally, when a pattern includes a form of support and resistance, “color\nwithin the lines,” so to speak. Victor Sperandeo in Trader Vic: Methods of a\nWall Street Master (another must-have book in every technical analyst's\nlibrary), says that ignoring a break of the trendline is always wrong.\nCommodity price charts offer more usable patterns than equity price charts,\naccording to Curtis Arnold, author of Timing the Market and Curtis Arnold’s PPS\nTrading System; “PPS” standing for “Pattern Profitability Strategy.” Arnold rec-\nommends using patterns (like triangles) together with confirming moving\naverages (see Chapter 12 for more on moving averages).\n\nCozying Up to Continuation Patterns\n\nPas\n\navr\n\nA continuation pattern tells you that buying or selling pressure is pausing. If\n\na big-picture trend is well established, the pattern suggests it will accelerate\nafter the pause. A continuation pattern, therefore, is a good place to add more\nto a position, because you expect an additional move in the same direction.\nContinuation patterns tend to be fairly short term, sometimes only a few days,\nand are often neglected as a consequence.\n\nContinuation patterns serve as reassurance that you've identified the trend\ncorrectly. They also often point you to the ideal level at which to place a stop-\nloss order, such as the ascending line in the ascending triangle that I describe\nin the following section. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion of stops.)\n\nAscending and descending triangles\n\nTo draw ascending and descending triangles, you draw a line along the highs\nof a price series and another one along the lows (see Figure 9-3) — just like\nyou do with symmetrical triangles.\n\nIn the ascending triangle, the price isn’t making new highs, and the topmost\n(resistance) line is horizontal. You may worry that the failure to make new\nhighs means that the up move is over. But the price isn’t making new lows,\neither. You can often expect a breakout of the top line to the upside.\n\nWhen you can draw a horizontal line along a series of highs, remember to look\nfor a rising line along the lows at the same time. Not only does the ascend-\n\ning line of lows confirm the trend continuation, but it also provides you with\n\na ready-made stop-loss level at this ascending support line. The ascending\ntriangle pattern delivers the expected rise about two-thirds of the time, but\naccording to Tom Bulkowski’s study, it fails about 32 percent of the time. If\nyou wait for prices to close above the top trendline, then the failure rate drops\nto a mere 2 percent. The expected rise, by the way, is equal to the height of\n\nthe triangle pattern. See the section later in this chapter on “Evaluating the\nMeasured Move.”\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Note that a dead-cat \nbounce occurs only in down moves and no equivalent named pattern exists \nfor a parallel sequence of events in an up move.\nThe dead-cat pattern starts off with a negative fundamental event that triggers \na massive down move. The average size of the down move is 25 percent — \nbut the price can shoot down by 70 percent or more in only a few days. The \nbounce is an upward retracement that may make you think the drop is over. \nThe pattern includes a breakaway downside gap about 80 percent of the \ntime, and sometimes the bounce upward fills part of the gap. (See Chapter 7 \nfor a discussion of gaps.) Many traders mistakenly think that if a gap is filled, \neven partly, the preceding move has ended. The dead-cat bounce is one of \nthe patterns that disproves that idea — by the end of six months after the \ngap, only 54 percent of price moves had fully closed the gap in the Bulkowski \nstudy, which found 244 versions of the dead-cat bounce pattern in 500 stocks \nbetween 1991 and 1996. See Figure 9-4.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Only about one-third of all\nthe patterns that look like a double bottom end up meeting the confirmation\ncriterion. In short, the pattern fails about two-thirds of the time.\n\nThese odds sound terrible, but wait — on the occasions when you do get\nconfirmation, the double bottom is tremendously reliable. If you wait for the\nprice to break above the confirmation line, the pattern delivers a profit an\nastonishing 97 percent of the time — and the average gain is 40 percent. The\naverage number of days to the ultimate high is 204 or seven months, in the\nBulkowski study.\n\nThe version of the double bottom that Figure 9-5 illustrates is clear and obvi-\nous, but not every pattern is so easy to detect. For example, one or both of\nthe two lows of the double bottom could be rounded rather than pointed.\nWhen the first bottom is pointed and the second is rounded, Tom Bulkowski\nnames it the Adam and Eve double bottom. You can imagine the other com-\nbinations, including two pointy bottoms (Adam and Adam) and the first one\nrounded with the second one pointed (Eve and Adam). This is, by the way, as\nracy as technical analysis ever gets.\n\nOften the two lows of a double bottom are separated by several months\n\nor even a year, and you can easily miss the pattern altogether. Also, minor\nretracements and even other patterns within the W can obscure the pattern.\nSome analysts note that big patterns lasting months are easier to see on\nweekly charts that skim off the aberrations in daily data.\n\nDouble tops\n\nA double top is the mirror image of the double bottom — it looks like the\nletter M. In a double top, the price makes a high, pulls back on profit-taking\n(as usual), and then bullish traders try but fail to surpass the first high. The\nfailure to rally a second time through the first high means that the bulls were\nbeaten and the bears are now in charge. A true double top is usually accom-\npanied by falling volume as the second top is being formed.\n\nAs with the double bottom (see the section “Double bottom” in this chapter),\nyou need to see the price surpass the confirmation level (the lowest point\n\nin the center bar of the M) for the pattern to be valid. When that condition\n\nis not met, twin tops fail to deliver a sustained down move 65 percent of the\ntime. When the condition is met, however, the pattern delivers a down move\n83 percent of the time, which is less reliable than the double bottom (97 per-\ncent), but still impressive. In the Bulkoswski study, the average drop after\n\na confirmed double top is 20 percent and lasts two months to the eventual\nlowest low.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Fortunately, the pull-\nback period averages only ten days before the downtrend resumes.\n\nTopping reversal patterns like the double top are usually more short term\nthan bottoming reversal patterns like double bottoms. Tops take less time to\nform (57 days on average) than bottoms (70 days), because traders are more\nfearful of taking losses after a big gain than they are trusting of early signs of a\nbottom. Topping reversals are often more volatile, too, although they occur\nwith equal frequency. According to Bulkowski, nearly all bottom chart pat-\nterns — of any type — perform better than tops. Bottoming patterns have\naverage gains of 38 percent, but tops show losses of just 21 percent.\n\nThese statistics confirm market lore that bull markets are easier to trade\nthan bear markets. Bull markets are more orderly and may suggest that\ngreed is stronger than fear. Bull markets tend to have wider and deeper par-\nticipation, too, because there are more traders who can go long than there\nare traders who can go both long and short, at least in equities. In equities\n(but not in securities like foreign exchange), buy-side gains are theoretically\nunlimited while gains on the short side are always limited — a stock cannot\nsell for less than zero.\n\nThe ultimate triple top:\nHead-and-shoulders\n\nA triple top or bottom is somewhat rarer than the double version, but the\nmeaning is the same — the price fails to surpass the previous low or high,\nsignaling a trend reversal.\n\nThe head-and-shoulders pattern is a triple top that’s easy to see: One bump\nforms the left shoulder, a higher bump forms a head, and a third bump forms\nthe right shoulder. (See Figure 9-6 for two examples.) The head-and-shoulders\npattern is the most widely recognized of all the patterns, and deserves its\npopularity because when the price surpasses the pattern’s confirmation line, it\ndelivers the expected down move a whopping 93 percent of the time.\n\nThe confirmation line connects the low point of each shoulder and is named\nthe neckline. The price breaking the neckline predicts a price decline,\nwhether the neckline is sloping upward or downward. Seldom do you see the\nneckline perfectly horizontal. A downward-sloping neckline tends to deliver\nthe biggest price move.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

A head-and-shoulders usually forms after a long\nuptrend. The dip from the first shoulder represents the normal retracement\nafter a new high. The head then represents the triumph of bullish sentiment\nand sets a new higher high. The dip after the higher-high head represents\nmore profit-taking, whereupon the bulls buy again. When the bulls are making\ntheir third try at a rally, their price target is the last highest high, which is the\ntop of the head. The failure of the second shoulder to surpass the head is the\nend of the rally. Buying demand diminishes and selling pressure takes hold,\nforcing prices down, completing the pattern.\n\nAccording to the Bulkowski study, which examined 500 stocks over the\nperiod 1991 to 1996, the head-and-shoulders pattern appeared 431 times and\nresulted in 406 reversals. A confirmed head-and-shoulders delivers an aver-\nage decline of 23 percent from the neckline, and the most often-seen decline\nis 15 percent. The average length of the pattern is 62 days.\n\nAs with double tops and bottoms, however, some traders refuse to accept\n\nthe pattern, and they cause a pullback to the confirmation line 45 percent of\nthe time. Pullbacks average only 11 days before the stock resumes its decline.\nThis is your last chance to jump off before the price hits the wall. Do not listen\nto that little voice that says, “See, it’s coming back.” That little voice is wishful\nthinking.

Volume is low at the second shoulder. Volume on the break-\nout day and the next few days after the breakout day, however, tends to be\nvery high. This is not surprising, because by now a great number of chart-\noriented traders have identified the pattern and its neckline. Some traders may\nsee only the break of support without having seen the head-and-shoulders\npattern, adding to the number of traders who now want to sell.\n\nThe head-and-shoulders patterns shown in Figure 9-6 are easy enough to see,\nbut many head-and-shoulders patterns are more complex and contain other\npatterns within them. The second head-and-shoulders pattern in Figure 9-6,\nfor example, contains a little double top and a gap (see Chapter 7). You may\nalso see what appears to be two heads or two shoulders, although one is\nalways higher, which makes it the head.\n\nEvaluating the Measured Move\n\nPas\n\nThe term measured move is used in a number of contexts in technical analy-\nsis, so it can become confusing. In essence, a measured move is a forecast of\nthe upcoming price move after a chart event, including completion of a pat-\ntern. Unfortunately, these forecasts are seldom correct, or rather, they vary\nby too much from actual outcomes to serve as reliable trading guides. Below,\nI outline three types of measured moves. (Point-and-figure charting also fea-\ntures its own version of the measured move — see Chapter 15.)\n\nTaking dictation from the pattern\n\nOne definition of measured move is the price change expected to result from\na particular pattern. For example, in the ascending triangle pictured at the\ntop of Figure 9-7, the gray lines denote the height of the pattern. Imagine that\nthe distance between the high and low within the pattern is $5. After the\nprice breaks out above the top of the triangle, you expect the subsequent\nrise to be the same amount, $5.\n\nOne useful (if general) observation is that the size of a move after a pattern\n\nis proportional to the size of the pattern. When a pattern takes a long time to\nform (three months or more) and when it is very deep (30 to 50 percent of the\nannual high-low range), the bigger the eventual reaction to the pattern.\n\nAs I mention in Chapter 11, you often get a sideways movement that results\nin a horizontal channel (a Darvas box), also called a rectangle.

Seldom are they exactly 100 percent of the height of\na pattern. Every pattern is measured in its own way. The expected move after\na head-and-shoulders pattern (described in the section “The ultimate triple\ntop: Head-and-shoulders” earlier in this chapter), for example, is measured\nfrom the top of the head to the neckline. You then subtract that number from\nthe neckline at the breakout point to derive the expected stopping point of\nthe down move.

This reversal\npattern is still valid, and if you own the security, you should exit at the pattern\nconfirmation neckline, because so many other traders are going to identify the\npattern and do precisely that, causing a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nResuming the trend after retracement\n\nAnother type of measured move is when a price repeats the extent of a first\nmove after a retracement. The retracement takes back 30 percent of the gain\nfrom the low to the high, or some other percentage. The point is that after\nthe retracement, you often see the price resume the trend at the same slope\nand to the same extent as in the first move.\n\nThis type of measured move is illustrated in the second chart in Figure 9-7.\nHere you see an already established channel consisting of support and resis-\ntance lines. (See Chapter 10 for more information on support and resistance.)\nThe price is oscillating between the two channel lines. After you see the price\nstop at Price C, you simply copy and paste the A-to-B move to C to arrive at\nprice target D.\n\nBulkowski found that in a measured move up, the first A-B leg averages 43\npercent over 87 days while the second leg, C-D, averages 37 percent in 65\ndays. You have to decide for yourself whether these numbers confirm or\nrepudiate the idea of the measured move. In a measured move down, the first\nleg averages 25 percent and the second leg averages 27 percent, and that\nseems to affirm the idea of proportionality. Note that the retracement in mea-\nsured moves up averages 14 percent over 45 days while in measured moves\ndown, the corrective retracement averages 16 percent over 39 days.\n\nMeasuring from the gap\n\nA third type of measured move is when you have a gap. (See Chapter 7 for a\ndiscussion of gaps.) A gap is a price bar whose high or low is separated from\nthe preceding bar by open space, meaning that no trades took place at those\nintervening prices. A gap is important because it shows, graphically, that\nsomething happened to alter perception of the security. In Figure 9-7, you\nmeasure the distance from the lowest low in the up move to the middle of the\ngap, and then project that height from the middle of the gap to the upside (in\nan uptrend). You do the opposite in a downtrend.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

So a trendline is a work in progress that needs constant\nreevaluation. Yes, this means that you need to check the price after the close\nto see where it stands in relation to the trendline. You probably know people\nwho check their prices every day. It’s a mystery why they do that if they don’t\nhave an analytical framework on which to judge the day’s outcome, even just\n\na rough hand-drawn trendline. To help in the process, you may extend a trend-\nline artificially out into the future in the hope and expectation that new prices\nwill be near it, but remember that the extended line is only a hope and expec-\ntation, and not real.\n\nThe time frame of the chart you're looking at influences what you see. A\ntrader with a long-term time frame may see one trend on a weekly chart,\nwhereas a swing trader with a shorter time frame in mind sees multiple\ntrends on the same chart. In order to see the single long-term trendline, you\nhave to accept that charting is a dynamic process. Your work is never done.\nEvery day (or hour or week) provides new data. You need to be ready, will-\ning, and able to discard a trendline when it stops representing the trend — or\nto restore an old trendline with some minor modifications if your original\ndrawing turns out to be right, after all. In this case, the move is a big-picture\nuptrend, but you don’t know it for sure until late in the move.\n\nYou may not be able to see or place a trendline on certain charts. No security\nis in a trending mode all the time. On other occasions, you draw one trendline\nonly to realize later that you can draw a better one. Some trends are orderly,\nmaking it easy to spot them, while other trends are disorderly and hard to see.\n\nFollowing the Rules with\nRule-Based Trendlines\n\nYou are welcome to draw any old line that your eye dictates, but rule-based\nlines have a long history of actually working to improve trading results, in\npart because everyone knows the rules and draws the same lines. This gives\nsome practical meaning to the phrase “reading the mind of the market.”\n\nA rule-based trendline is one that starts and stops according to well-defined\nconditions, such as a line starting at the lowest low of the last three days and\nending at the highest high of the last three days. A rule-based trendline is\nbetter than an impressionistic trendline for three reasons:\n\nIt doesn’t let you impose your personal view of what the trend should be.\n\nIt improves your ability (and self confidence) to buy a security when its\nprice is rising or sell it when the price is falling.\n\nIt helps prevent loss by showing you the exit at the right time.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

It’s named support because you expect the line to support the\nprice — traders won't let the price fall below it. You start at the lowest low\nand draw a line to the next low. This generates a line that can be extended at\nthe same slope, but it becomes a trendline only when another daily price low\ntouches the line and bounces off it.

This is ttue — many valid trends do have only two\ntouches before they end. If you’re waiting for the third touch, you may miss\nthe entire move. You may even say that two touches is better than three\n\nor more because that means this security doesn’t have a crew of wiseguys\nalways testing support.

When the support line does hold, the trad-\ners who were selling become big buyers. They’ve just been given proof that the\nbulls put their money where their mouth is. If you had bought and survived a\ntest of support, you are likely to get a fat gain after support was respected.\n\nWhen any part of the price bar penetrates the line on the downside, support\nhas been broken, and you may deduce that the trend is over. However, this\ntrend end may or may not be true. In Figure 10-1, the move continues after\nthe line was broken — but experience teaches that the trendline is no longer\nreliable. This analysis is logical because every market participant can draw\nthe same support line. A break of support is literally just that — some hold-\ners of the stock were willing to break ranks with the other holders and to sell\nat progressively lower prices.\n\nA breakout is any part of the price bar penetrating a line that you drew on the\nchart. Some traders require that to qualify as a breakout, the bar component\nthat breaks the line has to be the close. The word breakout is used in a dozen\ncontexts in technical analysis, but it always refers to a significant violation of\nthe trend. Sometimes the offending breakout is quickly roped back into the\nherd, but usually a breakout means that the trend has changed its nature —\nand usually that is an impending change of direction. In some cases, though,\na downside breakout of support that is immediately followed by a series of\nhigher highs indicates that bulls got a second wind and are violently repudiat-\ning the breakout. A continuation move after a downside breakout tends to be\nuncommon, so don’t count on it.\n\nSometimes the low extends beyond the support line for just one day, and\nthen prices obediently fall back into line. Subsequent prices respect the sup-\nport function of the line. A one-day break of the line is called a false breakout.\nThe word false is misleading because the price really does break the line;\nwhat’s false is the conclusion you draw from it.\n\nTo estimate whether a breakout might be false, master trader Larry Williams\nrecommends that you consider the position of the close on the day before\nthe breakout. In an uptrend, if the close is at or near the high, chances are\ngood that it’s a false breakout. The breakout was due to profit-taking that\ngot carried away, it was triggered by a false rumor, or it was a random move.\nIf the close on the day before is at or near the low, though, chances are the\nbreakout is real.\n\nDiscard the support line as a trading tool after it has been broken. However,\n\nyou may want to leave it on the chart for a while. Sometimes old support\nbecomes new resistance and vice versa.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "174\nPart IV: Finding Patterns \nThe other side of the coin: Using \nresistance to enter and exit\nResistance is the mirror image of support: A line drawn along a series of highs \nmarks where buyers resist buying more — the price is too high for them. \nTraders expect sellers to emerge at the resistance line (taking profit). You \nmay be wondering why you should care about resistance lines if all you ever \ndo is buy securities. As a buyer, the only trendline you care about is the sup-\nport line. But you should care about identifying a downtrend using the resis-\ntance line for two reasons:\n \n✓ When a downtrend ends, the next move may be an uptrend. You want \nto get in on the action as early as possible, so you care when a down-\ntrend is broken to the upside. The breakout is an important clue that an \nuptrend may be starting and you should start paying attention.\n \n✓ You may someday do the unimaginable — sell short. If you have been \ntrading exclusively in the U.S. stock market, chances are you’re not \nfamiliar with initiating a short position, or selling a security first and \nbuying it back later after its price has fallen. Commodity traders, on the \nother hand, are familiar with the practice. After all, we’re striving to be \nemotionally neutral about whether prices are rising or falling. Why not \nprofit symmetrically? To make a profit only when a price is rising is to \nlose 50 percent of the opportunity presented by trend-following.\nFigure 10-2 shows two resistance lines drawn according to the rule. The \nuppermost line correctly advised shorting this security at the third touch of \nthe line. The price falls off the cliff. But the price never returns to this first \nresistance line. Instead you get the opportunity to draw a new resistance line \na few months later.\nAn experienced trader would probably see the new line as an opportunity to \nincrease his short position. A long-only trader would be watching this second \nresistance line for the opportunity to buy the security — with a holding period \nthat lasts only until the price nears the topmost resistance line, where it will \nface (you guessed it) resistance. Note that selling this security on the third \ntouch of resistance and covering the short position when the price breaks the \nsecond resistance line would have given you a return of 20 percent.\nThe logic for trading using resistance lines is the same as for the support line \n(see the preceding section), but in reverse. The more times the high-of-the-\nday touches the resistance line and doesn’t cross it, the more confidence \nyou have that it is a valid description of the trend. This is called a test of \nresistance and encourages sellers of the security to sell more after the price \npasses the test. Fresh selling constitutes supply of the security and is called \ndistribution. Those who own the security are reluctant to hold it after resis-\ntance was proved to resist an effort to break above it. They’re willing to sell \ntheir inventory at increasingly lower prices.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The goal is to capture a portion of the trend. Famous trader\n\nBernard Baruch said he was willing to let others have the first third of a move\nand the last third of a move — he just wanted the middle third.\n\nFine tuning support and resistance\n\nYou need patience and persistence to work with trendlines, because you\nneed to adjust the lines often, sometimes daily. You will hardly ever be lucky\nenough to get a clear uptrend along a support line and then a breakout of the\nsupport line that turns into a downtrend with a tidy resistance line. Instead\nthe price will wander around and perhaps test the last high, which can be\nvery annoying if you sold at the break of support.\n\nSee Figure 10-3. This chart is an adaptation of one shown by Victor\nSperandeo in Trader Vic: Methods of a Wall Street Master. First is the break\n\nof the support line. But instead of an inverted V-shaped down move coming\nright afterward, the price tests both the highest high and a significant low\nalong the up move. It is only when it crosses under this previous significant\nlow that you are 100 percent certain that the move is over. Sperandeo calls\n\nit the /-2.3 method for identifying a change in trend. Not every break of sup-\nport looks like this, of course, but it’s an excellent model, not least because it\nreminds us that trends hardly ever end and reverse in one fell swoop.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n[Formulas: 10-2]",

TEST OF\n|-—— HIGHEST HIGH\n\nIf you grasp the 1-2-3 concept, congratulations! You have just met the most\nirksome, vexatious phenomenon in technical analysis — the pullback. It is\nalso called a retracement or correction. This usage can get confusing because\nretracement and correction have specific meanings in other contexts, so you\nstick to the word pullback to be safe.\n\nThe pullback is usually characterized by a roughly sideways movement that\noccurs after a trendline breakout and very often, just before it, too. The pull-\nback is a symptom of congestion, aptly describing the market participants mill-\ning around like people on a crowded sidewalk trying to dodge one another and\nimpeding progress in both directions as a result. Another term for a sideways\nprice movement is consolidation, referring to market participants consolidat-\ning their ideas about the security being traded. Consolidation often — but not\nalways — precedes a breakout of the trendline.\n\nCongestion and consolidation describe the same thing — trendless prices\ntrading in a range. Often the range is defined by a previous high or low.\nConsolidations often precede and follow a breakout. If you see a period\n\nof sideways price movement and can’t find the trend, widen your chart\n\nto include more data and switch to a longer time frame (such as weekly).\nChances are you are about to get or have just gotten a breakout.\n\nPlaying games with support\nand resistance lines\n\nThe chief issue with support and resistance is that the line itself becomes the\nfocus of attention, rather than the frend.

A large number of people draw and respect the same lines. Some\npeople want to defend the price because they own the security and want to see\nit survive a test of support so that more buyers are encouraged and it can rise\nsome more.\n\nOthers want the price to fall so they can buy the security more cheaply, or to\ncover a short position. In some instances, the big players in a market know\nwhere the small players have placed their buy or sell orders, because as\namateurs, they select the obvious support or resistance levels. The profes-\nsionals can then pick off the amateurs for a quick buck. As I note above, the\npros may push the price under a support line just to spook the amateurs into\nselling. You end up going through a tricky and complicated train of thought\nwhereby you don’t place your order at an obvious level because that’s\nexactly where the big guys expect you to — and then you miss an entry or\nexit at the best level.\n\nDrawing good and valid trendlines isn’t enough. You also want to study how\noften the crowd that trades your specific security chickens out at a resistance\nlevel or breaks support by a hair only to take the price up afterward. It’s not the\nline that counts — what counts is the crowd psychology that created the line.\n\nDrawing Internal Trendlines\n\nWouldn't it be nice to know the “true” trendline? This line would reveal the\nhidden trendedness of the prices without at the same time alerting every-\nbody and his brother to attack or defend specific levels.\n\nSuch a line does exist. It’s a line that goes through the center of the price\nseries rather than along its edges, like support and resistance (see the sec-\ntion “Following the Rules with Rule-Based Trendlines” earlier in this chap-\nter). How do you draw a straight line through the center of each price bar?\nTechnically, you can’t, as least not on any chart where the prices jump\naround at all.\n\nBut scientists have a solution to jumpiness: To “fit” a line that minimizes\n\nthe distance from itself to each price close along the line. The best-fit line is\n\nnamed the linear regression line, linear referring to line and regression refer-\n\nring to the mathematical calculation. You don’t need to know how the line is\ncalculated to be able to use it. You probably can’t explain an auto transmis-\n\nsion, either, but you can still drive your car.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Spreadsheet software and all charting packages\ncome with the linear regression already built in. Don’t shoot yourself in the\nfoot trying to do the calculations yourself when you could just as easily be sip-\nping a latté while a program does it for you.\n\nRules for drawing a linear regression\n\nThis section is a short one — you have no rules. Figuring out where to start\nand where to end a linear regression line is the first big obstacle in using the\nline in a practical way to help you make trading decisions. The simple answer\nis to start it at an obvious high or low, meaning that you need to look back-\nward at the historical data on the chart to see where the current move began.\n\nThis history check can be trickier than it sounds. You can get very different\nslopes, depending on how tightly you want the data to fit to the line. Seeing a\nwelter of slopes covering up your chart can get very frustrating. Stick with it —\npare back the surplus lines until you get one that looks the best to your eye.\n\nWhere do you end a linear regression? This takes some practice with other\nindicators, such as a gap, a giant outside day, a moving average crossover, a\nchange in momentum, or even a nontechnical development.\n\nYou may see charts by self-appointed gurus that show a linear regression and\nadvice that prices are “mean reverting” and exhibit a “central tendency,” mean-\ning that a big variation away from the linear regression line will automatically\ncorrect back to the linear regression. This is nonsense. I am not aware of any\nreputable trading system that features the linear regression as a trading tool.\n\nIdentifying trendedness\n\nIn Figure 10-4, the linear regression line doesn’t actually go through the\ncenter of each price bar. In fact, some price bars are quite far away from the\nline. But if you look more closely, you can see that no other line gets you as\nclose to Point A and to Point B at the same time. Only one linear regression\nexists for any set of prices on the chart. Despite its somewhat intimidating\nname, the linear regression should have you breathing a sigh of relief right\nnow because nothing is subjective or judgmental about it. It’s “science.”\nEverybody gets the identical line if they are given the same chart and the\nsame starting and ending points.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

If you select a good starting point, the linear regression delivers pure\ntrend. Unlike support and resistance lines (see the section “Following the\nRules with Rule-Based Trendlines” in this chapter), the linear regression line\ndoesn’t have any trading rules associated directly with it, but visually, the\nlinear regression line is the most informative.\n\nIf you draw a support or resistance line whose slope varies dramatically from\nyour linear regression line, one of them is wrong. In a similar vein, if the line\nhas a very steep slope and no other linear regression line on charts of the\nsame security has such a steep slope, you can deduce that the price move-\nment is statistically abnormal. It is unsustainably fast and likely to come to a\nsad end when traders start taking profit.\n\nThis crash and burn is exactly what happened in the NASDAQ in March 2000,\nthe “tech wreck.” Look at Figure 10-6.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n[Formulas: 10-5]",

    "text": "] bs 4 Part IV: Finding Patterns\n\nDiving into Channel-Drawing Basics\n\nPas\n\nPas\n\nA channel is a pair of straight-line trendlines (see Chapter 10) encasing a\nprice series. It consists of one line drawn along the top of a price series and\nanother line, parallel to the first, along the bottom of the price series.\n\nThe purpose of the channel is to train your eye to accept prices within its\nborders as on the trend and to detect prices outside its borders as off the trend\n(and perhaps ending the trend). In other words, the channel is a wider mea-\nsure of trending behavior than a single line. As long as prices remain within\nthe channel, you deduce that the trend is still in place.\n\nDepending on the raw material of your price bars, you can either\n\nStart with a top line connecting at least two highs, and draw the bottom\nline parallel to it.\n\nStart with the bottom line connecting at least two lows, and draw the\ntop line parallel to that.\n\nDraw a linear regression line, and draw the top and bottom of the chan-\nnel at equal distances on either side of it.\n\nHow do you know when a high or low is obvious and the right place to start a\ntrendline? An obvious high or low is named a swing point, because it’s the last\nhighest high or lowest low in a series of higher highs or lower lows. The trend\nmay seem to continue for a few more bars after the highest high or lowest\nlow. You don’t always get a sharp, clear-cut reversal exactly at the swing bar.\nBut a few days after a swing bar, the reversal or swing point becomes visually\nobvious. Can you mistakenly identify a swing point? You bet. When drawing\ntrendlines, you have to resign yourself to erasing a lot.\n\nYou can draw channels to enclose every part of every price bar in the series,\nor you can draw the channels to allow some minor breaking of the lines. (In\nthe section “Neatness counts” later in the chapter, I describe the pros and\ncons of allowing minor breakage.) Whatever your starting point (top, bottom,\nor linear regression) and whether you encase some or all the price series,\nconsider the top line of the channel to be resistance and the bottom line of\nthe channel to be support (see Chapter 10 for definitions of these terms).\n\nConstructing a channel by drawing parallel support and resistance lines orga-\nnizes your vision. You expect future price highs not to exceed the top of the\nchannel (resistance) and upcoming price lows not to exceed the bottom of the\nchannel (support). The parallel lines tell you the maximum probable future\nprice range. Note that word probable. Channels are visually compelling and\ncan seduce you into thinking that the forecast range must occur. It’s all too\neasy to start drawing channels and forget that they’re only a forecast. A zillion\nfactors can come out of the blue and knock your trend off the rails.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "BER\n\n18 6 Part IV: Finding Patterns\n\nWhy are the lines parallel?\n\nWhen you draw a support line connecting a\nseries of lows, you often see a parallel resistance\nline that mysteriously connects the highest highs.\nThis is so common that most charting software\nprograms have a standard command — “create\nparallel line.” No one knows why support and\nresistance lines are so often parallel. Here are\na few explanations:\n\nThis kind of orderliness appears when the\n\nhigh-low trading range is stable. Volume is\nsteady, too. An orderly crowd promotes an\norderly channel. Market participants know\nwhere the price is relatively high — atthe top\nof the channel. They expect no more gains at\nthis point and are prepared to sell at the top\nto put their money to better use in some other\nsecurity. Die-hard buyers, in turn, see when\nthe price is relatively cheap — down around\nthe support line. They add to their position,\npropelling the price upward.\n\nMany technical analysts perceive a cyclical\n\nquality to the ebb and flow of prices within a\n\nchannel. They rely on the security alternat-\ning between support and resistance, and\nthe perceived cycle is the basis of their trad-\ning plan. This often works, at least for short\nperiods, as long as you don't project the\nprice bouncing off the support or resistance\nline several cycles into the future. In other\nwords, don't get cocky. You never know\nwhen fresh news is going to come along and\ncause prices to break the channel.\n\n™ Humans have an innate need to impose\n\norder on a chaotic universe — or market.\nParallel lines don’t always appear, of\ncourse, but they appear often enough that\nobservers speak of trading ranges with a\ncertain air of authority. When you hear of\na trading range, this kind of parallel support\nand resistance channel is usually what the\ncommentator has in mind.\n\nNote that sometimes you later get a higher high and have to shift the entire\n\nresistance line up, keeping it parallel. Oddly, a high proportion of new highs\nstop at the old resistance line, even though some stop at the new resistance\nline, too. It’s like having two equally valid resistance lines. To be on the safe\nside, consider the farther-away channel line as the more-important one. The\nsame thing is true of a second, farther-away support line.\n\nOn the chart in Figure 11-1, the extension lines are gray. At the time they’re\nfirst drawn, the extended lines are hypothetical support and hypothetical\nresistance. Hypothetical means not proven.\n\nThe lines stop being hypothetical and become actual support and resistance\nwhen the next high or low touches the extended line but doesn’t break it,\nvalidating the extension process. The circles in Figure 11-1 mark where the\nnext high and low occur in this price series — and they occur at the hypotheti-\n\ncal support and resistance lines. You know that you've drawn your channel\nline correctly when a third relative high or low makes a touch of the line but\ndoesn’t cross it, making that touch a confirmation point.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Instead of drawing the support and resistance\nlines by hand and extending them out, you let the software do the drawing.\nSee the later section “Riding the regression range,” for information on how\nthe channel is calculated mathematically.\n\nWhichever way you draw the channel, apply the same expectations about the\ncollective behavior of the market participants, and assume that future rela-\ntive highs and relative lows are going to fall within the same range. The prin-\nciple of extending support and resistance lines is the same whether you draw\nthem by hand or use the linear regression as an anchor.\n\nConsidering the benefits of\nstraight-line channels\n\nWhen you use straight lines to represent a range, you get a chart that’s easy\nto read. Your eye fills in the blanks. The benefits include the following:\n\nStraight-line channels imply absolute limits that give you comfort and\nthe sense that you know where you stand.\n\nw When a new price touches the channel top or bottom, but then retreats,\nyou believe that the channel limits are correctly drawn and valid — and\nwill likely work next time, too. As ] explain in Chapter 10, the more often\na price touches a support or resistance line but doesn’t cross it, the\nmore reliable you can consider the line to be.\n\nIf a channel line is broken, you feel certain that something significant has\nhappened to the perception of the security by its market participants.\nViolation of the channel alerts you to changing conditions and the need\nto consider making a trading decision.\n\n\\NG/\nss\n\nA sense of certainty can be illusory and therefore dangerous.

But if your chart contains a dis-\norderly price move where prices jump around all over the place, your channel\nlines have to be so far apart that you can’t judge what is usual or normal.\n\nTo some extent, a channel is valid because many others can see the same\nthing. One of the reasons that a technical analysis method works is because\nit creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. When everyone can see the same lines, a\nconsensus builds as to what constitutes breaking the lines. When you draw a\nchannel so wide or so narrow that only you can see it, you can’t expect other\ntraders to respond to it. To forecast a price range is really to forecast the\nprobable collective behavior of the people who trade the security.\n\nUsing channels to make\nprofit and avoid loss\n\nWhen you have confidence that the channel broadly describes the trend, you can\n\nBuy near the channel bottom and sell near the channel top — over and\nover again, as long as the channel lasts.\n\nEstimate your future gain. If the width of the channel is $5 and you\nbought near a support line, your maximum probable gain over the next\nfew days is about $5 — as long as the channel remains in place and\nyou're able to sell near the resistance line. This is more useful than you\nmay think at first, because\n\ne It’s a sanity check. You can’t reasonably expect a gain that would\ncall for a price far outside the channel.\n\ne It’s a reality check. You can use the channel to evaluate a forecast\nmade by someone else. If the forecaster is calling for a price far\noutside the channel, you have grounds to question the forecast.\n\nCalculate your maximum loss. Regardless of where you bought the secu-\nrity, you know that when a price bar breaks the bottom support line of\nthe channel, the channel is no longer valid. The trend is likely over. This\nis the point at which you want to sell. And you don’t have to wait for the\nactual breakout. You can place a stop-loss order with your broker at the\nbreakout level (see Chapter 5).\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Chapter 11: Transforming Channels into Forecasts ] bf 9g\n\nDealing with Greakouts\n\nPas\n\nThe breakout is one of the most important concepts in technical analysis. It’s\na direct, graphic representation that something happened to change the mar-\nket’s sentiment toward the security. In the simplest terms, a breakout implies\nthat a trend is over, at least in its present form. After a breakout, the price can\ngo up, down, or sideways, but it seldom resumes at exactly the same level and\nrate of change you had before the breakout.\n\nA breakout must always be respected, but you want to be sure it’s authentic,\nwhich is what the following sections are all about. As I mention in Chapter\n10 and elsewhere, because so many traders draw support and resistance\nlines, there’s always some wiseguy in the market who tries to push the\n\nprice through the lines. In an uptrend that’s retracing downward, he tries to\nbreak the support line and panic holders into selling. He may believe in the\nuptrend; he’s just trying to get a lower price for himself. In a downtrend, he’s\nthe joker who buys so much that the price puts in a new high and a close\nhigher than on previous days, which scares the pants off sellers, who then\ncover their shorts and propel the price higher. In addition, a breakout can be\njust a random aberration.\n\nDistinguishing between false\nbreakouts and the real thing\n\nYou often see a tiny breakout and don’t know how to evaluate it. Say your\nsupport line is at precisely $10 and the low of the price bar is $9.75. Is that a\nlegitimate breakout or just an accident? As I note in many places in this book,\nsometimes you have to accept imperfection and live with ambiguity. The\nchannel lines are an estimate, not a certainty.\n\nOr sometimes you get a minor break of a channel line that lasts one or two\ndays but then the price returns back inside its channel and performs just as\nbefore. The breakout was a false breakout, which is a breach of a trendline\nthat then fails to deliver the expected additional moves in the same direction\n(see Figure 11-2). As I note in Chapter 10, to call it false is misleading, because\nthe price bar unmistakably breaks the trendline. What’s false is the conclu-\nsion you draw from it — that the trend is over.\n\nIn Figure 11-2, the channel does define the high-low trading range, after all.\nSometimes you have to accept one or two violations of your lines. The chal-\nlenge, of course, is that you don’t know right away whether a breakout is\nmeaningful or just a random outcome. I provide some answers to this ques-\ntion in the following sections.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

A simple\njudgment is to see whether the breakout is a violation of the channel line by\nthe close, and not just the high or low. As I explain in Chapter 6, the close is\nthe bar component that best summarizes sentiment. A high or a low can bea\nrandom aberration. The close is less likely to be random.\n\nA special version of the close rule is to evaluate whether the bar that breaks\nthe line is a key reversal bar, which is a form of outside day (see Chapter 7\nfor the outside day). When you're in an uptrend, the key reversal bar has a\npromising open — above yesterday’s close. The price even makes a new high\nover yesterday’s high, but then the price crashes and delivers a close at or\nnear the low and below yesterday’s low. The market psychology isn’t hard to\nread — the day started out well but then something happened to make nega-\ntive sentiment rule the day, right into the close.\n\nIn a downtrend, the key reversal bar initially confirms the trend — the open\nis below yesterday’s close and the price even makes a lower low. But then\nthe price reverses direction and rallies strongly into the close, so that the\nclose is above yesterday’s high. Good news must have come out.\n\nOpinion differs on whether the key reversal bar is definitive. Some traders\nswear by it, while others say that you wouldn’t want to make trading deci-\nsions on the key reversal bar alone — you should have additional confirming\nfactors or at least be able to verify the “news” that caused the abrupt change\nof sentiment during the day.\n\nDoes volume verify?\n\nBreakouts are often accompanied by a change in volume, usually an easily\nnoticed higher level.

You can verify that the breakout isn’t random by seeing an equiv-\nalent change in volume:\n\nIncrease in volume: Extraordinarily high volume on one or two days is\nnamed a volume spike and often accompanies the end of a strong trend,\neither a rally or a crash. Buying and selling interest is frenzied.\n\nDecrease in volume: If volume declines steeply after holding steady at\nabout the same level over the life of your trend, demand is falling off but\nso is selling interest. You don’t necessarily know what falling volume\nmeans, but it may foreshadow a breakout. All the people who wanted to\nsell have done so, and the people still holding an inventory aren’t willing\nto sell at the current price. It’s like a logjam. It will be broken up when\neither the bull camp or the bear camp takes the initiative and causes a\nnew high or new low, with accompanying higher volume.\n\nClues from other indicators\n\nWhile the breakout is a powerful technical indicator, you still want as much\nconfirmation as you can get. As I note in Chapter 8 on candlestick patterns,\nmomentum and relative strength are useful to confirm or deny that a break-\nout is real. Aloss of momentum and/or relative strength in an uptrend almost\nalways precedes a downside channel breakout.\n\nSize matters — and so does duration\n\nYou can use a filter to estimate whether a breakout is meaningful or can be\nignored. A filter is a formula or a procedure used to modify an indicator. In this\ninstance, the indicator is the break of the channel line. A filter can modify the\namount or duration of the breakout. Here’s how you do it:\n\nTo modify the size of the indicator, you add some percentage of the total\nrange to the channel line. You stipulate that to constitute a real break of\nthe channel line, the new high or low must surpass this extra amount.\n\nIf the channel is $5 wide, you can specify that a price has to violate the\nline by more than 5 percent (or 25 cents). Anything less wouldn’t bea\nreal breakout. Where does 5 percent come from? Why not 10 percent or\n20 percent? Either one may be effective, or neither. You need to experi-\nment with each security to see whether it has a habit of breaking its\nlines by this amount or that amount. You can also specify that the close\nhas to break the line by x percent to qualify as a real breakout. In either\ncase, the result is a new channel line that is a little farther out, effec-\ntively widening the channel.\n\nTo modify the duration, you can specify that you're willing to accept\none price bar violating the channel line, but not two. Or perhaps two\ndays of violation, but not three. Again, you have to experiment with each\nsecurity to see what its habits are. Also, you can combine the duration\nrule with the close rule and specify that the close beyond the line for x\nnumber of days is the sign of a true breakout.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "] g 2 Part IV: Finding Patterns\n\n\\NG/\ns\n\nPas\n\nExperienced technical analysts warn against making size and duration filters\ntoo complex and fancy, for a number of reasons:\n\nRules count. The breakout principle is a powerful and well-known con-\ncept. A lot of other traders in your security are likely to heed a breakout\nin a black-and-white way. They always exit on a downside breakout of\na support line by the low, for example. They feel that a breakout is a\nbreakout, and traders shouldn’t try to second-guess it.\n\nOne size doesn’t fit all. You can only know that 10 percent is the right\namount to put into your filter if 10 percent was the amount that worked\nin the past on this security. Each security has its own habits; or rather,\nthe people who trade it have their collective habits. In one security, the\nbest filter may consistently be 10 percent and in another, it may consis-\ntently be 40 percent. (In the 1930s and 1940s, a filter of 3 percent was\nstandard.) No single correct filter exists for every security under all cir-\ncumstances. You only know whether a filter is usable by testing different\nfilters on the price history of each security, one by one.\n\nBlending works only with coffee. The orderliness of your security can\nchange without warning. During some periods, a 5 percent filter may be\nthe most effective, but later, volatility can increase and you would need\na 10 percent filter to capture all the price highs and lows that really do\nbelong inside the same channel. Looking back over historical data to\nfind the best filter has an enormous flaw: Chances are that you'll come\nup with a blended percentage filter that’s too small for an orderly move\nand too big for a volatile one. And if today is the breakout day, you don’t\nknow how volatile the upcoming move is going to be.\n\nPutting breakouts into context\n\nA genuine breakout means that your trend channel is now defunct. You need\nto discard it. To verify that the breakout truly ended the trend, you need\n\nto evaluate it in the context of the general volatility characteristics of the\nsecurity itself. By examining conditions at the time of the breakout, you may\ngather clues as to what the price is likely to do next.\n\nNeatness counts\n\nAs a general rule, a breakout that occurs in the course of an orderly (low vola-\ntility) trend is more meaningful than a breakout that occurs in a disorderly\n(high volatility) trend. See Chapter 14 on volatility.\n\nFigure 11-3 illustrates this point. In the first chart, the security is orderly —\nprices line up neatly within the channel. The breakout is obvious. In the\nsecond channel, the security isn’t so tidy — prices jump around a lot. The\nbreakout bar is exactly the same size as the orderly channel breakout bar,\nbut in the disorderly price series, you can’t be sure that it’s authentic. The\npeople who trade this security are accustomed to big bars and big jumps.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

ORDERLY CHANNEL DISORDERLY CHANNEL\n\nOrderliness isn’t a word you find in the technical analysis literature. Instead,\nyou find volatility. Volatility refers to the extent of variation away from a cen-\ntral reference point (like an average). You should consider that low volatility\nconstitutes orderliness and high volatility implies disorder.\n\nThe more orderly your price bars, the more reliable your channels are. A\nbreakout of an orderly channel is more likely to be the real thing than a\nbreakout of a high-volatility (disorderly) channel. If you chose to trade a dis-\norderly security, you must be able to tolerate a high number of false break-\nouts — and modify your filters accordingly.\n\nay? If your security generates a lot of false breakouts and they make you nervous,\nfind another security. A number of vendors offer software you can use to scan\na collection of securities for those which are low volatility and therefore less\nlikely to generate a lot of false breakouts.\n\nTransition from orderly to disorderly (and back)\n\nWhen a price series morphs from an orderly to a disorderly mode, the trans-\nformation is almost always accompanied by a breakout and a change in\nvolume. Weirdly, a shift the other way also foreshadows a breakout. When\nprices shift from disorderly to orderly, the sharp decrease in volatility warns\nyou that a breakout is impending; buyers and sellers alike don’t know what to\ndo, so they do nothing. On the day of the breakout and in the day or two fol-\nlowing, you see a big increase in volume.\n\nDriving faster is always risky\n\nYou also want to know the context of the breakout in terms of where the\nprices were located within the channel just before the breakout.

In\nother words, higher volatility can mean an acceleration of an existing trend.\nA breakout can be to the upside in an uptrend as well as to the downside in\n\na downtrend.\n\nFigure 114 illustrates an upside breakout in an uptrend. It’s still a breakout,\nand you should expect that it still marks a change in the trend even though\nit is in the same direction. The acceleration of an existing trend should make\nyou sit up and take notice. While it may simply signal a steepening of the\ntrend as the crowd develops enthusiasm for the security, it can also occur\nnear the end ofa trend.

As I describe in Chapter 10, the linear\nregression is the line that minimizes the distance from itself and every point\nof the chart. It is the true, pure trendline, and thus the channel built on it,\nnamed the standard error channel (also called the linear regression channel)\nshould be the true trend channel. You can calculate the standard error by\nhand, but it’s laborious. Software is less error prone and a lot faster.\n\nYou use a channel based on the linear regression line the same way that you\nuse a hand-drawn support and resistance channel, as you can see in the fol-\nlowing sections. By projecting the lines out into the future, you get a forecast\nof the future price range, and you deem a significant breakout of a channel\nline as ending the trend.\n\nWith hand-drawn support and resistance channels, the channel is defined by\nthe outer limits (the series of higher highs with higher low, or lower lows with\nlower highs). No centerline exists. In the linear regression channel, you build\nthe channel from the inside out, so to speak. You start with a center linear line\nand draw the outer lines from that.\n\nIntroducing the standard error\n\nComputer software places the standard error channel on either side of the\nlinear regression line, according to the statistical measure named the stan-\ndard error. Like the standard deviation you discover in Chapter 2, you don’t\nneed to know how to calculate this number or even precisely what it means\nin order to use it effectively.\n\nThe standard error measures how closely the prices cluster around your linear\nregression line. Most chartists use two standard errors, which results in a\nchannel top and channel bottom that enclose a high percentage (95 percent)\nof the highs and lows. An extreme high or low constitutes a bigger error away\nfrom the trendline than 95 percent of the other highs and lows.\n\nThe closer prices are to the linear regression line, the stronger the trend.\nHere are a couple points to keep in mind:\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

A price that doesn’t\nvary at all from the linear regression is literally “on the trend” and has a\nzero standard error.\n\nIf you draw a channel and see that it’s very wide, your price series has\na lot of variation away from the linear regression. Prices far from the\nnorm, the linear regression, are called outliers and when you have a lot\nof them, they are collectively called noise. The more noise, the less reli-\nable your channel.\n\nDrawing a linear regression channel\n\nHow “true” the linear regression and its channel turn out to be depends on\nwhere you start drawing. See Chapter 10 for a discussion of starting the linear\nregression in a reasonable place.\n\nYou start a linear regression channel at an obvious low or high, draw a chan-\nnel line from there to a second relative low or high, and then extend it out. The\nparallel line comes along for the ride, which often helps you adjust the slope of\nthe line by discovering relative highs or lows that you didn’t see at first.\n\nAs with the hand-drawn support and resistance channel lines (see earlier sec-\ntions in this chapter), you know that you have drawn your channel line cor-\nrectly when a third relative high or low makes a touch of the line but doesn’t\ncross it. Sometimes the “obvious” swing high or low occurs within a previous\nchannel that has been broken and discarded: Go back to the swing bar and\nuse it as the starting point for the new channel.\n\nFigure 11-5 shows a nicely uptrending security with two channels. Look at the\nshorter one first. I start it at the lowest low, and let the software do the draw-\ning to the bar after the next relative low. Then I stop drawing and extend the\nlines by hand, using dotted lines to mark them as hypothetical.\n\nIt isn’t until three months later that prices break out of the channel — to the\nupside. Oh, oh. A breakout always means something. When it’s a breakout in\nthe same direction as the trend, you start worrying that it may be a blowout\nbreakout, as I describe earlier in the chapter in the section “Driving faster is\nalways risky.” Whatever it turns out to be, you still need to discard the old\nchannel. It has been broken. In this case, I left it on the chart.\n\nNow I draw a new linear regression and its channel (the darker lines on the\nchart) from the same lowest-low starting point, and keep drawing until just\nafter a new relative high appears. I know it’s a relative high because it’s\nbreaking the top of the channel and followed by a lower high. I stop drawing\nat that relative high and extend the channel lines out, as before. Notice that\nthe price does it again! It breaks out of the top of the channel a second time.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

For instance,\nwhen it comes to the linear regression channel, you want to know the following:\n\nThe linear regression doesn’t encompass every price extreme ina\nseries. It encompasses a very high percentage of them. Therefore, some\nprice bars will always break the channel lines without invalidating the\nchannel, unlike the situation in a hand-drawn channel.\n\nTo make it more unlikely that you'll mistake a normal breaking of the\nchannel line with a breakout, you can widen the channel lines to encom-\npass the first two or three highest highs and lowest lows, and then\nextend it out. This modification is named a Raff regression channel after\nGilbert Raff, the man who devised it.\n\nYou can adjust the width of the channel lines by instructing your soft-\nware to use three errors rather than the usual two. A three-error chan-\nnel encloses 99 percent of the prices. This is handy for a just-emerging\nchannel where you don’t have many prices yet.\n\nThe linear regression is self-adjusting. Every time you update the chan-\nnel, your software includes the new day’s data and modifies both the\nlinear regression line and the slope and width of the channel accord-\ningly. It’s therefore a bit of an odd duck — a set of straight lines that\nisn’t fixed, at least until you fix it by halting the updating process.\n\nIn order to see a breakout to confirm a trend change, you have to stop\ndrawing at some point. Otherwise, the channel simply adjusts to the new\ndata and you never get a breakout. Don’t forget, it automatically incor-\nporates all the price data you put into it. Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nair You can draw new channels on top of your existing forecast channel. You\nbegin at the same starting point but continue the true channel to the current\nday. If the width and the slope of the fresh true channel are about the same\nas your forecast channel, you deem the forecast channel to be stable. A stable\nchannel implies that the forecast embedded in the farther-out lines is proba-\nbly pretty good. If you notice that the new, true channel that incorporates the\nlatest prices is starting to widen, narrow, or change slope, examine the price\nbars themselves to see if they indicate a trend change. See Chapter 6 and 7 for\ninformation on the price bars.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Some of the complications are\n\nNota majority process: A large number of people draw support and\nresistance lines and channels, but not everyone draws linear regression\nchannels. A big part of why technical analysis works is that many people\nare observing the same thing and acting on it, like breakouts. The same\ncan’t be said of linear regression channels.\n\nMay not stand alone: You can draw a very large number of channels on\nthe same chart, and each of them is “right.” Often you draw one channel\nfrom an obvious starting point but after fixing it and extending it out into\nthe future, you find that you can draw another channel from a nearby\nstarting point that points to a different outcome. I call this dueling chan-\nnels, and it always occurs at trend turning points.\n\nNot really “scientific”: The linear regression channel is scientific in\nthe sense that the software calculates it to enclose a preponderance\nof prices, but that doesn’t mean that you started it or stopped it at the\nideal spot, or that the channel extension is correct. The mathematical\nprinciple isn’t subjective, but your application is always subjective.\nConsider that your car works on scientific principles of internal combus-\ntion and the like, but that doesn’t necessarily make you a good driver.\n\nPivot Point Support and\nResistance Channel\n\nWhat do you do when you stop getting higher highs (in an uptrend) or lower\nlows (in a downtrend)? In other words, the price is still within its channel but\nnow it is moving sideways.\n\nThe pause in movement may be temporary, but the sideways action can also\nbe a warning that forward momentum is gone. From this you may deduce that\nif you’re going to take profit, now is the time. The sideways action may also\nimply that a breakout in the opposite direction is impending.\n\nOne technique for dealing with sideways moves within a channel is to draw\nhorizontal support and resistance lines off pivot points. Technical traders\nuse the term pivot point in many different ways. One standard definition\n\nis that the pivot point is the center bar of three bars (or more) where the\ncenter bar is the highest high or lowest low.

This is named \nR1. To calculate the first (inner) line of support, or S1, multiply the pivot value \nby two and, from that number, subtract the high of the pivot day. This proce-\ndure sounds like a lot of arithmetic, but don’t sweat it. It’s easy enough to do \nin a spreadsheet or by hand, and many trading platforms offer it as a standard \noption. Plus, the procedure itself is quite sensible — you use a multiple of the \nmedian price to estimate a range going forward that subtracts the high and \nthe low to yield a norm. Any price higher or lower would be an extreme. If the \nupcoming price breaks the horizontal support and resistance lines calculated \nthis way, the direction of the breakout is your clue that the trend is truly over.\nYou can create a series of pivot support and resistance lines according to \nthese formulas or some variation of them:\nPivot Point = (High + Close + Low)/3Support 1 = 2 × Pivot – High\nSupport 2 = Pivot – (R1 – S1)\nSupport 3 = Low – 2 × (High – Pivot)\nResistance 1 = 2 × Pivot – Low\nResistance 2 = Pivot + (R1 – S1)\nResistance 3 = High + 2 × (Pivot – Low)\nIn Figure 11-6, R3 is very close to the highest high and S3, while higher \nthan the recent lowest low, meets the hand-drawn support line connecting \ntwo lows. Pivot point analysis has become very popular in recent years. \nAdvocates say that by projecting out a reasonable range to the next few \ndays, you can easily see a breakout, and pivot points are therefore predictive \ninstead of lagging, like every other indicator. This is not, strictly speaking, \naccurate. Any band or channel has predictive value in the sense that upcom-\ning prices, if they are normal, will remain within the band or channel and a \nviolation of the channel top or bottom constitutes a breakout. What is valu-\nable about pivot points is that when many market participants are looking at \nthe same lines, you can expect price movement at exactly those lines.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Most traders\nstart out in technical analysis with moving averages, and some trad-\n\ners never see a need to look into any other technique — that’s how success-\nful moving averages can make your trading.\n\nA moving average is an arithmetic method of smoothing price numbers so\nthat you can see and measure a trend. A straight line (see Chapter 10) is a\ngood visual organizing device, but a dynamic line — the moving average —\nmore accurately describes what’s really going on. In addition, you don’t need\nto choose starting and ending points, removing that aspect of subjectivity,\nalthough choosing how many periods to put in your moving averages is sub-\njective. In this chapter, I discuss several different ways you can calculate and\nuse moving averages to get buy/sell trading signals.\n\nBe careful not to attribute a forecasting capability to the moving average. Moving\naverages are trend-following. The moving average is a lagging indicator — it can\nstill be rising after your price hits a brick wall and crashes.\n\nIntroducing the Simple Moving Average\n\nBER\n\nYou know what an average is — you measure ten of something, add up the\nmeasurements, and divide by ten. Here’s how you get the average “moving”:\nStart by finding the average of a number of prices — say ten. The next day you\nadd the newest price to the total and subtract the oldest price, keeping the\ntotal number of prices constant at ten. The standard simple moving average\nuses the close, because the close is the summary of the period’s action and\nsentiment (see Chapter 6).\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The result is\nbuying at lows and selling at highs. The moving average crossover rule gener-\nates a profit. What could be better? Right about now, you may be tempted to\nshout “Eureka! I have discovered a systematic, objective trading system.”\n\nNot so fast. For one thing, the price doesn’t always obediently stay above the\nmoving average after an upside crossover (or below the moving average after\na downside crossover). See the price bars on Figure 12-1 marked “Outlier.”\nFirst you get a close above the moving average and then the next bar is almost\nentirely above the moving average. An outlier is just what it sounds like —a\ndata point that lies far off the trendline. This particular chart is tidy — it has\nonly a pair of outliers. Usually you see a lot more.\n\nIf you use the crossover rule to buy and sell a security every time the close\ncrosses the moving average, you get a lot of buy/sell signals that reverse in\nfairly short order, as this one does. In Figure 12-1, you don’t know at the time\nit’s happening that the outliers are abnormal. For all you know, the crossover\nabove the moving average is a genuine indication of a reversal. You know only\nafter the price resumes the down move that they were outliers.\n\nTable 12-1 shows the gains and losses following the moving average cross-\nover trading rule. Notice that I include the short side, which is selling some-\nthing you don’t own in the expectation that you'll be able to buy it later ata\ncheaper price. To sell short is only to reverse the normal order of the buy/\nsell equation. Usually you buy before you sell, but if you see a price clearly\ntrending downward, in many cases you can sell it today and buy it back later\nfor a profit. Even if you never sell short, calculating total profitability accu-\nrately is important when you evaluate a trading rule like the moving average\ncrossover rule. For one thing, a rule that applies equally well to down moves\nas to up moves is more likely to be correct in all cases. For another, the end\nof a short sale may be the start of a purchase trade.\n\nTo evaluate a trading technique, including moving averages, you judge its\neffectiveness on the basis of its profitability from identifying trends going in\nboth directions.\n\nTable 12-1 Hypothetical Profit from the Simple Moving\nAverage Crossover Rule\nNo. of Days Action Price Crossover Buy-and-\nProfit Hold\n19 days Buy $70.61 $70.61\nSell $76.00 $5.39\n(continued)\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But in the process of trading the cross-\novers, you take two losses caused by the outliers.\n\nIn measuring the profitability of the crossover rule, I assume a policy of stop-\nand-reverse, which means you close out one trade and put on another in the\nopposite direction at the same time and at the same price. This method is the\nconventional way to calculate the profitability of a trading rule, at least the\nfirst time around. Later you may adjust your entry and exit rules, as I discuss\nin the section “Filtering out whipsaws” section later in this chapter.\n\nDealing with the dreaded whipsaw\n\nA buy/sell signal that’s wrong (in hindsight) is called a false signal. In moving\naverage work, the false signal is a crossover that reverses within a few days,\nlike the outliers in Figure 12-1. False signals usually reverse fairly quickly,\nputting you back in the trade in the right direction, but in the meanwhile,\nyou take a small loss, called a whipsaw loss. Whipsaw refers to the whipping\naction of the price quickly moving through the moving average in both direc-\ntions, resulting in a series of back-and-forth trades. Whipsaws occur in even\nthe best-behaved trend and are common in a sideways market where traders\nare indecisive about trend direction.\n\nWhipsaws have a pernicious effect on your profit and loss statement in two ways:\n\nWhen trading a trend-following technique like the moving average cross-\nover, you make most of your gains by riding big trends, and you accept\nthat gains are going to be reduced by the occasional whipsaw at reversal\npoints, sideways periods, and any spiky outlier. But if your big trends\nalso contain whipsaws, you end up overtrading, which is to make a lot of\ntrades for only a small net gain or loss.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In all the cases in this\nchapter, I am conveniently not subtracting commissions and fees, but\nremember that they reduce profits and raise losses in real life.\n\nFiltering out Whipsaws\n\nInstead of using the raw crossover of price and moving average to generate a\nbuy/sell signal, you can set up additional tests, called filters. If the crossover\npasses the filter tests, chances are it’s a valid buy/sell signal and not a flash\nin the pan. Filters come in several varieties, and you can apply any or all of\nthem to reduce the number of trades. Note that filters may delay entry and\nexit, and therefore may reduce total gains while reducing whipsaw losses.\n\nConsider the following filters:\n\nTime: The close has to remain above (or below) the moving average for\nan additional x number of periods after the crossover date.\n\nExtent: The price has to surpass the moving average numerical value by\nx percent of the price or x percent of some other measure, such as the\ntrading range of the past y days (see Chapter 7 for information on the\ntrading range).\n\nVolume: The crossover has to be accompanied by a significant rise in\nvolume.\n\nExtreme sentiment: In an uptrend crossover, the low has to surpass the\nmoving average and not just the close; in a downtrend, the high has to\nbe under the moving average, and not just the close. See Chapter 6 fora\ndiscussion of the high, low, and close.\n\nUsing the moving average level rule\n\nInstead of looking at the crossover, you can call the end of an uptrend when\nthe moving average today is less than the moving average yesterday, and you\ncall the end of a downtrend when the moving average today is higher than\nyesterday’s. The moving average level rule usually calls the end of trend ear-\nlier than the crossover, although not always.\n\nA moving average always lags the price action. In Figure 12-1, look at the\nprices and moving average in the left-hand ellipse. From the peak close, it\ntakes the price six days to cross below the moving average — and fen days\nfor the value of the moving average to be lower than the day before. By the\ntime the moving average puts in a lower value than the day before, it’s Day 10\nand the price has fallen from $82.49 to $75.38, or by 8.6 percent.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But before you go off the deep end, consider that I\nrigged the case by finding an ideal chart like Figure 12-1. It wasn’t hard to find,\nbut for every ideal situation like this, thousands more can be found where\napplying a 10-day simple moving average crossover or the moving average\nlevel rule results in heartache and losses.\n\nThe security in Figure 12-1 is trending, and in a tidy fashion. Aside from one\noutlier, prices don’t vary much away from the moving average. But this same\nsecurity goes through periods when it is neither trending nor tidy. Moving\naverages lose their power to help you make money when either of these two\nconditions arises:\n\nNot trending: Prices can move sideways for long periods of time while\nthe market makes up its mind what to do next (congestion). In that\ninstance, the moving average is a horizontal line. You get no buy/sell\nguidance from moving average techniques in a sideways move like the\none shown in Figure 12-2. This particular one is tidy, too — no outliers.\nBut a sideways movement defeats trend-following by definition.\n\nNoisy: A price series with many prices varying far from the moving aver-\nage is said to have a lot of noise, likening outliers to the static you get on a\ncar radio as you move out of signal range. The second chart in Figure 12-2\nshows a tidy trend, with few outliers. The third chart is the same moving\naverage, but it arises from a price move with many outliers.\n\nThe trader using moving averages faces a perpetual task of reducing noise\nwhile also reducing lag, and these two goals are hard to achieve simultane-\nously. Fixing noise entails using a higher number of periods in the moving\naverage, while fixing lag entails using a shorter number — as you can see in\nthe following sections.\n\nFixing noise\n\nYou can’t do anything about a sideways move (except perhaps trade the\nsecurity on a shorter time frame that may contain minitrends). But you can\ndo something about noise — apply a moving average with more days in it.\nYou want to minimize losses, and a noisy price series makes you vulnerable\nto false buy/sell signals. When you use a higher number of days in the moving\naverage, say 50 days, noisy outliers get put in their place, arithmetically\nspeaking. An abnormally high or low price relative to the existing average is\nless important in a 50-day moving average than in a 10-day moving average,\nbecause it literally carries less weight in the calculation.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Chapter 12: Using Dynamic Lines 2 13\n\nNo single number of days is best for a moving average. The best number is the\none that fits how noisy the prices are. If your prices are so noisy that you\nwould have to use a high number of days in the moving average, resign your-\nself to getting late exits long after the price peak. Or you can find a different,\nmore orderly security to trade.\n\nMagic moving average numbers\n\nSome technical traders think that securities prices move in cycles that are\nrelatively fixed, such as three-to-four weeks, three-to-four months (and its\ndouble, six-to-eight months), and three-to-four years. Therefore, they imagine\nthat you should gear the number of days in your moving average to these\ncycles. But while cycles do exist, too many of them exist. They overlap, and\nnobody can agree on a single one that rules securities prices all the time,\n\nor which one is ruling the market at any one time. You won't find statistical\nproof of cycle theories consistently working in securities markets, and you\nwill certainly see thousands of situations that don’t conform to them.\n\nAs I note in Chapter 2, whether or not fixed-length cycles are true doesn’t\nmatter. If a sufficient number of traders believe they’re true, sometimes trad-\ners cause the predicted cycle to occur. Popular moving averages are 28 days\nand half of 28 days (14 days), and the combination 5-10-20 days, or a varia-\ntion, 4-18-40. The 28-day number was devised as a monthly number in appar-\nent disregard of the trading month having 20 to 22 days compared to the\nlunar or calendar month. Systems designers joke that the 4-day moving aver-\nage was devised to ace out the people using the 5-day, and the 9-day to get in\nfront of the traders using the 10-day moving average.\n\nThe bottom line: Be skeptical of buying into a magic number. The spirit of\ntechnical analysis is empirical: What does the data say?\n\nOne moving average really does stand out — the 20-day. When a security is\ntrending, the 20-day moving average often works the same way a support\nline works — sellers stop selling when it’s reached. Less often, the 20-day\nmoving average constitutes resistance. (I describe support and resistance\n\nin Chapter 10.) The virtue of a moving average that works as support or\nresistance is that you don’t have to choose a starting and ending point — the\nmoving average is nonjudgmental and everyone gets the same line. Many\ntraders plot the 20-day moving average on every chart to get a feel for what\nother traders in the market may see as a benchmark level.\n\nYou may also see the 20-day moving average tracking the linear regression.\nWhen you see this confluence, you get a sense that maybe the market has\nsome underlying order after all. Beware of superstition! The sense of order-\nliness may not be an illusion in any particular case, but remember that no\ntrend lasts forever. At the turning point, the 20-day moving average is dead\nwrong, so enjoy it while you have it.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Keep \nreading this section to find out how.\nGetting acquainted with \nmoving average types\nMoving averages are often abbreviated. You may see SMA and wonder what \nthat is. SMA stands for the simple moving average (and you feel like an idiot \nafter you figure it out). Likewise, the moving averages I cover in the following \nFolklore versus trading tools\nYou see reports that Blue Widget stock just sur-\npassed its 50-day moving average, or its 200-\nday moving average, or that its 50-day moving \naverage crossed its 200-day moving average, a \nso-called “golden cross.” This type of informa-\ntion may or may not be interesting and useful. \nMaybe the price had been within a few pennies \nof the 200-day moving average for months on \nend, and just managed to inch over it. Why is \nthis news?\nWithout a context, a price crossing a moving \naverage of a fixed number of days is just \nanother statistic. Because of research by tech-\nnical trader Richard Donchian, the 5-day and \n20-day moving averages became popular, and \nthat makes sense — 5 days is a week and 20 \ndays is (roughly) a month. But 50 days and 200 \ndays are just round numbers unrelated to the \ncalendar (the number of business days in a year \nis about 240). And as I note in this chapter, the \nbest number of days to put in a moving aver-\nage is the smallest number that still generates \nas few whipsaws as possible. By choosing a \nnumber as high as 50 or 200 days, you’re con-\ndemning yourself to an inefficient parameter \npractically by definition.\nBut that would be to mistake a barometer of the \nenvironment for a trading tool. If you’re looking \nfor an indicator to describe the general tone of \na security or market index, the 200-day moving \naverage is pretty good — mostly because it is \nin vogue. To use a fixed number like 50 or 200 \nmakes sense only if everyone else is looking at \nthe same number, and increasingly, they are. \nEven people who profess to dislike and distrust \ntechnical analysis give credence to the 200-day \nmoving average.\nBut what exactly does it mean? Well, the 200-\nday moving average doesn’t have a proven \nmeaning. A security whose price falls below \nthe 200-day moving average has fallen out of \nfavor with traders, and one whose price is in the \nprocess of crossing above the 200-day moving \naverage is back in favor. The financial press \nsometimes reports a “death cross,” or the \n50-day moving average crossing below the 200-\nday. Death cross is a semantically loaded term \nthat has no statistical basis for reliably predict-\ning outcomes. This technical jargon example \nis an instance where language influences the \noutcome far more than the event the language \nis purportedly describing.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You get the weighted moving average\nby multiplying each price in your series according to how fresh it is. Ina\n5-day moving average, for example, Day 5 (today) would be multiplied by 5,\nDay 4 by 4, Day 3 by 3, and so on. Remember to divide the total by the sum of\nthe weights, not the sum of the days (56+ 4+3+2+1=15).\n\nMore popular than the weighted moving average is the exponential moving\naverage. This moving average is hard to calculate, and fortunately, all the\ncharting software packages can do it for you. The principle is to subtract\ntoday’s closing price from yesterday’s exponential moving average.\n\nWhen you begin, start with a simple moving average. Multiply the difference\nbetween today’s price and the moving average by a constant smoothing\nfactor (the exponent). The factor is determined by the number of days you’re\nusing in the moving average, say 10 days. The exponent is calculated by\ndividing 2 by 10, yielding 0.2 as the factor. If you’re using 20 days, you divide\n2 by 20 and get 0.1 as the factor. Here’s why:\n\nThe factor minimizes the change between the existing moving average\nand the latest price, creating a smaller bridge than in a simple moving\naverage, which has to bridge the entire distance between today’s price\nand yesterday’s. This factor gives the moving average a numerical value\ncloser to the last price and thus makes it more representative of recent\nprices.\n\nThe fewer the number of days in the moving average, the bigger the\nfactor. This principle closes the gap between the moving average and\nthe latest price even more.\n\nAdaptive moving averages\n\nThe adaptive moving average works like a long-term moving average in that it\ndiminishes the effect of outliers, but without sacrificing sensitivity to trended\nprices. You always want a moving average to be as short as possible to iden-\ntify the beginning of a trend quickly, but as long as necessary to avoid whip-\nsaw losses.\n\nIn other words, sometimes you want the moving average to contain a small\nnumber of days, and other times you want it to contain a higher number of\ndays. You don’t want to be forced to select the number yourself, because\nyou have no way of knowing in advance which is right. You want some auto-\nmatic mechanical adjustment to kick in when variability changes, to adapt\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You can’t change the number of\ndays according to conditions, but you can get the same effect by making the\nmoving average adaptive.\n\nA trading systems designer named Perry Kaufman devised an ingenious way\nto achieve this adaptiveness for trading purposes and called it the adap-\n\ntive moving average. It is abbreviated KAMA, for Kaufman’s adaptive moving\naverage, while other versions of the adaptive moving average are usually\nnamed just AMA or have the inventor’s initial, like Richard Jurik’s JAMA. The\nKaufman process of performing the adaptive calculation begins with a con-\ncept called an efficiency ratio, which measures how straight the line prices\nfollow as they move from one point to the next.\n\nEfficient prices follow a straight line. They receive an efficiency rating of 1.\nPrices that are inefficient resemble the meandering path of a drunken sailor.\nThey get an efficiency rating of zero. Most prices are somewhere in between.\nThe rating is then converted to a smoothing constant (which is confusing\nbecause in this application, it’s not constant, but changes depending on the\nnumbers; constant is a term used by mathematicians for a term in a formula\nbecause it’s constantly there, whatever its numerical value). As the smooth-\ning constant gets closer to 1, the moving average tracks the prices more\nclosely. When the smoothing constant is zero, the moving average value\ndoesn’t change and is carried over unchanged from yesterday — in other\nwords, a spiky outlier is simply ignored.\n\nChoosing a moving average type\n\nTraders debate which type of moving average is the best. Figure 12-3 shows\nexamples of all four of the moving averages | discuss in this chapter, and that\ndoesn’t come close to exhausting all the possible modifications.\n\nEach version of moving averages has strengths and weaknesses. The\nweighted moving average is the most sensitive to the latest price moves, fol-\nlowed by the exponential moving average. Notice that the KAMA is the best\nat chopping off the spiky outlier prices that make the price series noisy. That\nmeans it works best at reducing whipsaw losses, too. But it gives a value of\nzero to the breakaway gap like the last bar on this chart. (See Chapter 7 for\n\na discussion of gaps). In a trend reversal like the one depicted on this chart,\nthat’s a drawback. You enter the new trend later than if you used a nonadap-\ntive technique, but as an offset, you don’t get very many false signals.\n\nDon’t invest the moving average with supernatural powers. It’s only arithme-\ntic. A moving average can’t capture every important move and in fact, rides\nroughshod over some important chart events, like breakaway gaps. The\nmoving average is a repackaging of the price series, not the price series itself.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "221\n Chapter 12: Using Dynamic Lines\nDelving into Moving Average \nConvergence and Divergence\nWhen the price crosses over a moving average, or one moving average \ncrosses over another, you have a chart event with an embedded trading deci-\nsion. But the crossover is a blunt instrument. You can often see a crossover \ncoming, but if you’re following rule-based discipline, you’re twiddling your \nthumbs waiting for the actual crossover.\nIf you look at any two moving average crossovers, you see that at a turning \npoint, the short moving average converges to the price and the long-term \nmoving average converges, a bit later, to the short-term one. By the time the \ncrossover actually occurs, the price peak (or trough) has already passed.\nSimilarly, after a crossover, the two moving averages diverge from one \nanother. Wouldn’t it be nice to quantify the convergence and divergence? \nThen you’d have a measure of market sentiment. You could say that senti-\nment is turning against the current trend when the moving averages are con-\nverging and market sentiment is confirming the current trend as the moving \naverages diverge.\nHere are the convergence and divergence basics you need to know:\n \n✓ Convergence: When two moving averages converge, the trend may be \ncoming to an end. Convergence is therefore an early warning. Because \nmoving averages are always lagging indicators, measuring convergence \nis a way of anticipating a crossover.\n \n At a peak, one way to look at the convergence is to say that short-term \ndemand is faltering — traders are failing to produce new higher closes. \nThe trend is still in place, as shown by the long-term moving average. At \na price bottom, you can interpret the short-term moving average falling \nat a lesser pace as selling interest (supply) falters.\n \n✓ Divergence: Conversely, when you can see a lot of daylight between \ntwo moving averages, they’re diverging, and that means the trend is safe \nfrom a crossover, at least for another few periods. In practice, abnor-\nmally wide divergence tends not to be sustainable and can be a warning \nof prices having reached an extreme ahead of reversing.\nTo get the ins and outs on how to calculate and use convergence and diver-\ngence to maximize your trading, check out the following sections.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

That sounds backwards, but stop\nand think about it for a minute. If the price and moving averages are rising,\nthe long-term moving average is a smaller number, say $10, than the shorter-\nterm moving average, say $15. The short average minus the long average\nequals $5. Now the price passes its peak and falls. The short-term moving\naverage loses steam and the next day it is $13, while the long-term moving\naverage is still climbing. Today’s price drop is a drop in its bucket. The long-\nterm numerical value is $12. Now the difference is only $1. From $5 to $1 is\nconvergence.\n\nThe inventor of the moving average convergence-divergence indicator\n(MACD), Gerald Appel, designed it to use exponential moving averages of 26\nand 12 days, although the MACD is a model into which you can insert any\nmoving average that suits your fancy and backtests well on your security. (I\ndiscuss backtesting in Chapter 4.)\n\nThe chart in Figure 12-6 shows a 12-day and 26-day moving average in the\n\ntop window. In the bottom window is the result of subtracting the 26-day\nmoving average from the 12-day moving average, which is the convergence-\ndivergence indicator. When the indicator line is rising, the two averages are\ndiverging. When the line is falling, the averages are converging. At zero differ-\nence between the two averages, you have the crossover. You can verify this\ncrossover by checking the actual moving averages on the price chart.\n\n91\n90:\n89\n88\n87\n86\n85\n84\n83\n82\n81\n80:\n\nDIVERGENCE\nyaanaye. \"LLLL\n\n24 fff? fia et pet fb fi2 fig 7 ep fie 3s [go 7 ta\nPp Apr May une\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The plain\nmoving averages don’t save you from the gap, either (for more on gaps, see\nChapter 7). The MACD’s forecasting ability makes it one of the most popular\nindicators. But watch out for attributing too much to it. A shock can come\nalong and cause the price to vary wildly from the trend, whereupon the ten-\ndency to converge or diverge becomes irrelevant. A new price configuration\ndevelops, and because the MACD is comprised of moving averages, the indica-\ntor still lags the price event like any other moving average.\n\nInterpreting the MACD\n\nYou may find it hard to “read” the MACD indicator, except when the trigger is\nactually crossing the indicator line. You’re not alone. Another way of display-\ning the MACD, in histogram format, is much easier on the eye. See Figure 12-8.\n\nIn Figure 12-8, each bar in the histogram represents the difference between\nthe two moving averages on that date. You don’t use the trigger line in the\nhistogram, because you can choose by eye how fast the histogram bars are\nclosing in on the zero line, or diverging from it. At zero, the two moving aver-\nages have the same numerical value — they have zero difference between\nthem. As the bars grow taller, the difference between the two averages is\nincreasing (divergence), and this movement favors the trend continuing.\nWhen the bars stop growing and start to shrink, the two moving averages are\nconverging — watch out for a signal change.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In this case,\nthe “object” is the price of a security. Momentum is also a generic term\ncovering a number of technical indicators, although many momentum indica-\ntors don’t use the word momentum in their names. In this chapter, I introduce\nyou to some momentum indicators and give you tips on how to use them.\n\nThe terms momentum and rate of change are used interchangeably in techni-\ncal analysis. The indicators look almost identical on a chart. Unless you plan\nto write formulas, the tiny differences don’t affect your analysis. I use the\ngeneral term momentum throughout this chapter because it’s easier.\n\nIn general, you can use momentum indicators to generate buy/sell signals or\nto evaluate buy/sell signals generated by other indicators. Momentum is a\nleading indicator and can be used to offset the lag inherent in trend-following\nindicators like moving averages. Momentum indicators excel at spotting an\nimpending move when the market is moving sideways, and certain momentum\nmeasures are central to recognizing when a security is overbought or over-\nsold. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of overbought and oversold.)\n\nDoing the Math: Calculating Momentum\n\nEverything you really need to know about momentum is that it compares the\nprice today with the price x periods ago. A higher number means a faster\nspeed — and momentum is all about speed. But how do you reach that calcu-\nlation?

If the price is lower today than ten days before, it will be a\nnegative number — but now you know by what amount in percentage terms.\n\nFor example, say your security typically doesn’t reach a speed of more than\n30 percent in any ten-day period before pausing or retracing. You can use\nthis useful ingredient to predict a new move, using momentum as a leading\nindicator. When you see the indicator reach the 30 percent mark, you expect\ntraders to do what they usually do: Cause a price pullback by taking profit.\nYou can anticipate them and exit early, join them at the same time, or wait it\nout, depending on the other conditions on the chart and your trading plan.\n\nBy observing momentum over time, you can discover the maximum speed\nthat your security is likely to reach in a specific period of time, like ten days.\nYou may, of course, choose three days, or five days, or any other number of\ndays.

    "text": "23 2 Part V: Flying with Dynamic Analysis\n\nPas\n\nv5\n\nSmoothing price changes\n\nWhen you look at Figure 13-1 earlier in this chapter, you probably notice that\nthe momentum indicator looks a lot like the price series, only smoother, and\n\nwith the indicator’s highest highs and lowest lows a day or two off the price’s\nhighest highs and highest lows.\n\nMomentum sometimes mirrors the price move. This reflection is because,\n\nlike a moving average (see Chapter 12), the momentum indicator is tracking\nthe close relative to the close a certain number of days back. The more days\nyou put in your lookback period, the smoother the momentum line. Unlike the\nmoving average, momentum doesn’t include all the days’ closes in between,\nand by omitting that extraneous information, you get a smoother line.\n\nHowever, if you have a one-day price spike, you may see a jump in momen-\ntum, but ten days later you’re going to see a sudden drop in the momentum\nindicator, too, as that spike (see Chapter 7) leaves the data series. This type\nof situation is when it pays to look at the price bars and not just the indica-\ntor. If the spike was a one-day anomaly, the information you think you're get-\nting from momentum can be misleading.\n\nMomentum isn’t a trend indicator like a moving average, and yet it seems\n\nto track the trend. How can this be? The answer lies in the nature of price\nmoves, which are caused by human beings and all their emotions (see\nChapter 2). When a price starts to rise, traders jump on the bandwagon and\ncause the price to move to higher prices at a faster pace. So it’s not surpris-\ning that the slope of the price move often steepens at the same time as the\nslope of the momentum indicator. When traders stop adding to positions,\ncloses may still be higher, but by less than they were at the beginning of the\nmove. The trend remains in place and is still delivering profits to you, but at\na slower pace.\n\nFiltering momentum\n\nA smooth line is visually more helpful, but you may want momentum to be\nmore responsive to price changes. Therefore, you could shorten the number\nof days in the comparison from ten to (say) three. A three-day momentum\nindicator is more sensitive, but it also crosses the zero/100 line repeatedly\nwhen the price isn’t trending, or is trending only slightly, generating small\nlosses called whipsaws. (See Chapter 12 for more on whipsaws.)\n\nThe standard solution to whipsaws is to filter the signal. Instead of making the\nzero/100 line the buy/sell rule, you can dictate that the indicator has to rise\n(say) 2 percent over the zero/100 line for a buy and fall 2 percent under it for\na sell. You can also delay accepting the buy/sell signal for one or more days.\nYou can backtest both kinds of filters by using historical data.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Chapter 13: Measuring Momentum 2 33\n\nDepending on the security, up moves and down moves aren’t ordinarily sym-\nmetrical in size, duration, or speed. Sometimes your security has up moves\nthat accelerate strongly but decelerate in a sloppy, slow manner. Remember,\nevery security has it owns habits.\n\nFor instance, if a security usually delivers a momentum reading of plus 130\nto minus 130, this reading means that the price tends to speed up or slow\ndown by not more than 30 percent over the course of any ten-day period.\nSome securities are like old Chevy pickups — their momentum lumbers from\nplus 120 to minus 120 over many months, while other securities are sprightly\nAston Martins that zip between plus 150 and minus 150 in a few weeks.\n\nMany commentators speak of a momentum cycle as though it were a scientific\nfact of life. It’s not, but you must make up your own mind on whether price\ncycles are real, and if they are real, whether they’re useful to your trading.\nSometimes you can see an eerie regularity in the momentum indicator, espe-\ncially in longer time frames (like weekly and monthly data).\n\nApplying Momentum\n\nThe momentum trading rule is simple: Buy when the indicator crosses above\nthe zero line and sell when it crosses below the zero line. The zero line is the\nlevel at which the current price is equal to the price x number of days ago.\nWhen the momentum indicator crosses above zero, the price trend is upward,\nand the indicator is signaling you to buy. When it crosses below zero, the\ntrend is downward, and the indicator is signaling you to sell.\n\nHowever, because momentum measures the rate of change and not the price\nitself, it has some peculiar properties, which I discuss in detail in the following\nsections.\n\nDiscovering divergence\n\nMomentum can be a confusing indicator, because your eye is accustomed\nto interpreting a line that is pointing upward as having to do with the dollar\nvalue. But in this case, this upward line refers only to the speed of the price\nchange. The distinction is driven home when you have a price that is rising\nwhile momentum is falling.\n\nDivergence refers to momentum that moves in the direction opposite to the\ndirection of the price trend. Divergence also refers to momentum higher or\nlower, but less high or low than a previous peak or trough, while the price\ntrend is making a new higher high or lower low. Technically, they’re both\ngoing in the same direction, so it’s a misnomer to call it a divergence, but when\nmomentum falls proportionately short of the price move, you can think of it as\na failure to confirm. See Figure 13-2 for a visual of the divergence concept.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Then it flattens, meaning that the new price gains aren’t as\nrobust as the older price gains. Notice that momentum crosses the buy/sell\nmidline on the very next day after the highest price high. This instance is an\nideal example of using momentum as a buy/sell indicator in its own right.\n\nIf you sell when the momentum indicator crosses the buy/sell line, you exit\nnear the peak.\n\nVolume can be a useful adjunct to momentum-price divergence. As I note in\nChapter 11 regarding breakouts, as a price trend is peaking, you usually see\nan abnormal rise in volume. A volume spike often foreshadows the end of a\nstrong trend. If you have both spiking volume and momentum-price diver-\ngence, get ready to bail out — the end of the move is nigh.\n\nConfirming trend indicators\n\nA change in momentum is a reliable guide to a change in price trend. A new\nuptrend is almost always preceded by rising momentum. Most of the time,\nmomentum peaks ahead of the price peak, generating divergence in the direc-\ntion of momentum and price — a valuable warning that the trader should be\ngetting ready to exit.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n[Formulas: 13-2]",

A confirma-\ntion rule requires that both indicators agree before you make a trade. Using\nmomentum to confirm another indicator\n\nRaises the probability of a trade being profitable\n\nReduces the total number of trades\n\nReduces the proportion of whipsaw trades\n\nDetermining the Relative\nStrength Index (RS1)\n\nPas\n\nYou may wonder why you have to wait for the momentum indicator line to\ncross the zero line. Why not make the buy/sell decision when the momentum\nindicator changes direction — just after an indicator top or a bottom? After\nall, you expect a move to keep going in the same direction after it starts.\n\nA technical trader named J. Welles Wilder, Jr. answered the question. He pointed\nout that you want to make the trading decision at the change of direction only\nby ensuring that the average up move is greater than the average down move\nover a certain number of days (or the other way around for a sell signal). In\nother words, the average momentum is relatively higher (or lower), hence the\nname relative strength. Be sure to differentiate between the comparative relative\nstrength between two securities and the infernal relative strength I discuss here.\n\nThe RSI is much faster than momentum in signaling an impending price\nchange, making RSI a good tool for timing profit-taking, especially if you are\nusing a shorter-term version (say 5 days rather than the standard 14 days).\nHowever, the RSI falls short in the reliability department when it comes to\nbuy/sell signals. For that reason, traders use RSI more often as a confirming\nindicator, while they use other indicators to obtain the buy/sell signal.\n\nIn the following sections, I outline how you can do the relative strength index\n(RSD math and visualize it on a chart. Plus, you can also discover some of the\nnuances of using the RSI.\n\nCalculating the RSI\n\nThe RSI measures the relative speed of price changes. The relative strength\nindex uses averages over several days rather than single price points.\nHowever, it uses the ratio method, like momentum. To figure the RSI, you\nfirst calculate relative strength (RS) over a specific number of days. The\ncalculation looks like this:\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

This arithmetic process creates\nan oscillator that is limited to a range of zero to 100. When the indicator is at\nor near zero, it means that the security is fully oversold. When it is at 100, the\nsecurity is overbought.\n\nThe relative strength index and indeed most oscillators rarely go all the way\nto zero or 100 percent, but rather vary between the 30 and 70 percent mark\nof the entire range. In some instances, you may find that the 20 to 80 percent\nmark is better, or even 10 to 90 percent.\n\nThe RSI, like most oscillators, is limited by one of its arithmetic components,\nthe high-low range over x periods. You may have a 75-day uptrend, for exam-\nple, that has five or six sell signals generated by an RSI that is using 14 days as\nthe base range. They’re false signals if you’re a long-term trend-follower, but\nsplendid opportunities to goose return if you’re a swing trader. As | explain in\nChapter 4, the trend-follower has one set of buy/sell signals, while the swing\ntrader has multiple entries and exits. The RSI is a top swing trader tool.\n\nPicturing RSI\n\nIn Figure 13-3, the RSI is shown in the top window, with two momentum indi-\ncators in the second window (a raw momentum indicator and a smoothed\none containing more days), and the price chart itself in the main window. The\ngray trendlines are hand drawn, just for orientation.\n\nOn the left of the chart, as the price is rising, the RSI and momentum rise,\ntoo. RSI, however, hits and surpasses the 70 percent limit and starts turning\ndown the very next day after the highest close. Momentum also turns down,\nbut doesn’t cross the center sell line for another two weeks. The RSI then\nfalls to the bottom of its range at an index reading of 30 percent.\n\nBecause you're using averages, the indicator has a normal range of between\n30 and 70 percent of the maximum range, although touches of the maximum\nextremes do occur as follows:\n\n Overbought: When the RSI is at or over the 70 percent level, the secu-\nrity is considered overbought (which I describe in Chapter 2). An over-\nbought condition is when the security has moved so far and so fast that\ntraders want to take profit. You can automatically sell when the security\nbecomes overbought (when it crosses the 70 percent line), or you can\nuse the line as a confirming indicator with other indicators.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

By analyzing the internal dynamics of the price (the ratio of aver-\nage up days to average down days), the RSI indicator tells you not to sell the\nsecurity short at this point, even though the price is still falling, because it is\nabout to reverse to an up move. (Remember, to sell short is to sell the secu-\nrity first and buy it back later at a cheaper price.)\n\nIf you’re a buy-only trader, hang on. Your chance is coming. Finally, you can\nsee that an up move starts again and hits the overbought level on the right-\nhand side of the chart in Figure 13-3. Again, the RSI peaks on the same day\nas the price high. Notice that momentum peaks a week earlier, but has not\ncrossed the buy/sell centerline before the chart ends.\n\nUsing the Rest of the Price Bar:\nThe Stochastic Oscillator\n\nSo far, the momentum indicators all use the closing price. But a lot can be\ngoing on in other parts of the price bar, such as closes near the high versus\ncloses near the low. When the close is near the high and each high is higher\nthan the day before, you not only have an uptrend, but an uptrend that is\naccelerating. In a rally, you expect prices to close near the high of the daily\nhigh-low range. In a sell-off, you expect the price to close near the low of the\ndaily high-low range.\n\nTwo relationships are particularly important: The high-low range over x\nnumber of days, and the relationship of the close to the high or the low over\nthe same x number of days. (If you use the low, the resulting indicator is\nnamed the stochastic oscillator, and if you use the high, the indicator is named\nthe Williams %R, after its inventor, Larry Williams.) In the following sections,\nI outline how to use the stochastic oscillator as an indicator.\n\nNo indicator name is worse than this one. The word stochastic refers to\nrandomness, which of course is the exact opposite of what you're trying to\nachieve in applying technical concepts — finding order. It gets worse — the\nfirst component of the indicator is named the %K, because that was the letter\nof the alphabet assigned to the list of experimental formulas by its inventor,\nGeorge Lane. The second component of the indicator is called %D, for the\nsame reason. %K is called the “fast” stochastic and %D is called the “slow”\nstochastic, as you can discover in the next section. The good news: %K and\n%D appear only in the stochastic oscillator and aren’t used anywhere else in\ntechnical analysis.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "ANG\nss\n\nChapter 13: Measuring Momentum 2 3 9g\n\nStep 1: Putting a number to\nthe fast stochastic YoK\n\nThe %K indicator takes the difference between today’s close and the lowest\nlow of the past five days and divides that by the widest high-low range of the\npast five days. The ratio is then multiplied by 100 to make it an oscillator that\nranges between 0 and 100, again with a normal spread between 30 and 70\npercent or from 20 to 80 percent. Five days is the standard parameter used\nfor the indicator, although you can use software to find a number of days that\nbetter fits your particular security.\n\nThe %K indicator shows you how much energy the price move has rela-\ntive to the range. If today the closing price is higher than it was yesterday,\nit is farther away from the lowest low than it was yesterday, too. If neither\nday put in a new high or low, the high-low range usually remains the same.\nArithmetically, therefore, today’s %K is a higher number than yesterday’s,\nand the line on the chart has to rise, as follows:\n\n%K = (Current Close — Lowest Low)/(Highest High — Lowest Low) x 100\n\nBut here’s a brainteaser: What about the case in which the high-low range\nover the past five days is $5 to $12 and today’s price is $12? If today’s close\nis $12, the highest high, the top part (numerator) of the ratio is today’s close\n($12) minus the lowest low, $5, or $7, exactly the same as the five-day range,\nor the bottom part of the ratio (denominator). As you discovered in grade\nschool doing fractions, $7 divided by $7 is 1, and if you multiply it by 100,\nyour oscillator reading is 100. The indicator is telling you that the price is as\nhigh as it gets relative to the range.\n\nAnd a lot of good that does you! You already know that the price made a new\nclosing high today. When that happens, the %K gives a reading of 100 percent,\nwhich by definition is an overbought condition — even if the price is still trending\nupward! This is exactly what happens in the section of the chart in Figure 134\nmarked by an ellipse. You see that the price has moved smartly up, with several\ngaps to boot (see Chapter 7 for a discussion of gaps). When the %K indicator (the\nthin line) reaches 100 percent, it’s telling you that the security is overbought. If\nyou used the %K line alone as a buy/sell indicator, you might sell at this point —\nand miss out on another $10 rise in the security.\n\nThe stochastic oscillator gives a false overbought or oversold reading at a\nnew highest high or lowest low, because the highest high or lowest low is then\nused in both the numerator and denominator of the ratio. Therefore, the sto-\nchastic oscillator works best in a sideways price movement. This is also true\nof the Williams %R, which is essentially the same indicator, only upside down.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

What you really want is the\nequivalent of the zero/100 line in momentum — some kind of crossover\nguideline to tell you whether to buy or sell, so you don’t have to guess by\neye. In the stochastic oscillator, the crossover line is named %D and is\nformed by a short-term simple moving average of %K (the higher line in\nFigure 134). A moving average always smoothes and slows down the price\nseries so %D is sometimes called the smoothed indicator as well as the “slow”\nindicator. When you put the two indicator lines together, you get crossovers\nof the first indicator line by the smoothed shorter-term indicator line that\ngive you exact buy/sell signals.\n\nYou can calculate %D with the following formula:\n%D = Three-Day Simple Moving Average of %K\n\nWhen %K crosses above %D, it’s a buy signal, and the other way around for\na Sell signal. It’s convenient when crossovers occur promptly at overbought\nor oversold levels but you will see plenty of crossovers that occur when the\nsecurity is not overbought or oversold. Note that you can add numerous\nfancy modifications to the stochastic oscillator, including a “slowing” factor\nin %K.

For example, see Figure 13-5 that shows some of the nuances\nof the stochastic oscillator. Here the stochastic oscillator shows a series of\nthree higher highs in the indicator that have %D rising over %K in “right”\ncrossovers (to the right-hand side of the peak), implying hidden power is in\nthe up move on the left-hand side of the chart that cannot be discerned from\njust looking at the prices themselves.\n\nBut look again.

Both concepts of volatility are\nvalid and useful. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk.\n\nA change in volatility implies a change in the expected price range to come. A\nvolatile security offers a wide range of possible outcomes. A nonvolatile secu-\nrity delivers a narrower and thus more predictable range of outcomes. The\nmain reason to keep an eye on volatility is to adjust your profit targets and\nyour stop-loss to reflect the changing probability of gain or loss.\n\nIn this chapter, I describe three ways you can measure volatility, and discuss\ntheir virtues and drawbacks. Then I describe the most popular way trad-\n\ners incorporate consideration of volatility into their trading plans — the\nBollinger band. I also introduce another kind of band — the average true\nrange band.\n\nCatching a Slippery Concept\n\nVolatility is a concept that can easily slip through your fingers if you aren’t\ncareful. Just about everybody uses the word volatility incorrectly from a stat-\nistician’s viewpoint — and even statisticians squabble over definitions. To\nthe mathematically inclined trader, volatility usually refers to the standard\ndeviation of price changes (see the “Considering the standard deviation” sec-\ntion). Standard deviation is not the only measure of volatility, but it suffices\nfor most technical analysis purposes. In general usage, volatility means vari-\nance, and that’s how] use it in this chapter.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "2 4 4 Part V: Flying with Dynamic Analysis\n\nPas\n\nPas\n\nVariance is a statistical concept that measures the distance on each bar\nbetween the high and low from the mean (such as a moving average). You\ncalculate variance by taking the difference between the high or low from the\naverage, squaring each result (eliminating the minus signs), adding them\nup, and dividing by the number of data points. Squaring magnifies wildly\naberrant prices, so the bigger the variation from the average and the more\ninstances of such big variations in any one series, the higher the volatility.\n\nTraders do not use variance as a stand-alone measure or indicator, and\n\nit’s not offered in software charting packages. Why? Because variance isn’t\ndirectly useful as a separate measure from the standard deviation, which is\nessentially the square root of variance.\n\nTime frame is everything. How you perceive volatility depends entirely on\n\nthe time frame you're looking at. Failure to specify a specific time frame is\nwhy you see so many conflicting generalizations about volatility. The period\nover which you measure volatility has a direct effect on how you think about\nvolatility and, therefore, what kind of a trader you are. Your trading style isn’t\nonly a function of what indicators you like, but also of how you perceive risk.\nTwo traders can use the same indicators but get different results because they\nmanage the trade differently by looking at volatility differently (scaling in and\nout, choosing a stop-loss level, and so on).\n\nIn Figure 14-1, your eye tells you that the low-variance prices on the left-hand\nside of the chart are less volatile and therefore less risky to trade than the\nhigh-variance prices on the right-hand side of the chart, even when the high-\nvariance prices are in a trending mode. And that’s the point about volatility — it\ndescribes the level of risk. In the following sections, I go into more detail about\nthe nature of volatility, including both high and low levels.\n\nHow volatility arises\n\nThink of volatility in terms of crowd sentiment. Volatility rises when traders\nget excited about a new move. They anticipate taking the price to new highs\nor lows, which arouses greed in bulls putting on new positions and fear in\nbears, who scramble to get out of the way in a cascade of stop losses. The\nstart of anew move is when you get higher highs and lower lows. Volatility\ntends to be abnormally low just before a turning point and abnormally high\njust as the price is taking off in the first big thrust of a new trend. It is also,\nhowever, a sad fact of trading life that sometimes volatility is high or low for\nno price-related reason you can find.\n\nHigh volatility means trading is riskier but has more profit potential, while low\nvolatility means less immediate risk.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You have no basis on\nwhich to form an expectation of a gain, and without an expectation of gain,\ndon’t trade it. You can reduce the time frame (from one day to one hour, for\nexample) to make visible and tradeable the minor peaks and troughs. Note\nthat options traders don’t care about trendedness and see trading opportuni-\nties in both extra-low and extra-high volatility environments.\n\nIf a price is trading sideways without directional bias but the high-low range of\nthe bars contracts or widens, now you're cooking with gas. Range contraction\nand expansion are powerful forecasting tools of an upcoming breakout. You\ncan start planning the trade. In Figure 14-1, every bar is the same height except\nthe ones in the circle, which are narrowing. The drop in high-low range and\ntherefore in volatility often precedes a breakout, although you don’t know in\nadvance in which direction unless you also have a reliable pattern (Chapter 9),\nincluding candlesticks (see Chapter 8).\n\nHigh volatility with trending\n\nYou may think that the degree of volatility doesn’t matter when your secu-\nrity is trending, but an increase in volatility automatically increases the risk\nof loss. You may start fiddling with your indicators to adapt them to current\nconditions. Tinkering with the parameters of indicators when you have a live\ntrade in progress is almost always a mistake. A better response to rising vola-\ntility is to recalculate potential gain against potential loss (Chapter 5).\n\nHigh volatility without trending\n\nWhen a security isn’t trending but has high volatility in a wide range, it’s\ncalled “trader’s nightmare.” This is the right-hand section of the price series\nin Figure 14-1. In this situation, the range is so wide you can’t identify a break-\nout; you see spiky one- and two-day reversals as bulls and bears slug it out,\nmaking it hard to find entries or to set systematic stops.\n\nThe solution to high volatility in a nontrending case is to stop trading the\nsecurity, or to narrow the time frame down to an intraday time frame. Often\nyou can find tradeable swings within 15-minute or 60-minute bars that don’t\nexist on the daily chart. (Another choice is spread trading in options.)\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Chapter 14: Estimating Volatility 2 4 7\n\nMeasuring Volatility\n\nPas\n\n\\NG/\ns\n\nPas\n\nVolatility is the degree of variation of a price series over time. You can\nmeasure volatility in plain or fancy ways. In financial analysis, volatility\nusually means one thing — the standard deviation, which I discuss in the\n“Considering the standard deviation” section later in the chapter. Before\ntackling that, look at other useful measures of volatility.\n\nTracking the maximum move\n\nOne way to measure volatility is to capture the largest price change over x\nnumber of days — the maximum move, also called gross move. You subtract\nthe lowest low from the highest high over 10 days or 100 days or some other\nnumber of days. You use the resulting maximum move to set a profit target\n(maximum favorable excursion) or worst-case stop loss (maximum adverse\nexcursion). See Chapter 5 for information on setting stops.\n\nIn Figure 14-2, the top window shows the highest high in a rolling 30-day\nperiod minus the lowest low in the same 30-day period — the maximum\nmove. Notice that at the beginning and middle of the chart, you could make\nas much as $30 in a 30-day period in this security, but then the volatility of\nthe price change tapers off to under $10 by the end of the chart. At that point,\nyou're taking less risk of a catastrophic drop in the price over any 30-day\nperiod, but your profit potential has just been cut to one-third of its previous\nglory, too — the usual trade-off between risk and reward. Keep reading for\nmore on the maximum and minimum moves in the following sections.\n\nVolatility changes. Projecting the volatility of the last 30 days to the next 30\ndays is to assume conditions will not change — but conditions always change.\n\nMaximum move and trend\n\nIn Figure 14-2, seeing the connection between the 30-day maximum move in\nthe top window and the prices in the bottom window is hard. The straight\nline starting at the middle of the bottom window is the linear regression (see\nChapter 10). The line slopes upward, meaning that the price is in a slight\nuptrend — but at the same time, volatility is on a downtrend. This is a good\ncombination for you — trendedness is delivering new profits at an ever-lower\nrisk of a big one-period loss. But remember, low volatility precedes a break-\nout, so it may not be a good deal for long.\n\nThe price trend can differ in size and slope from the vo/atility trend. Sometimes\nthey’re in sync, rising or falling together, or they can move in opposite direc-\ntions. Knowing something about the trend in the maximum move doesn’t\nnecessarily tell you anything about the trend in prices, and vice versa. In other\nwords, volatility is often independent of price trendedness.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In the case of a\ndownside move like the one in Figure 14-5, traders could have been overly\nexuberant in taking profits after such a big run up to the high. See the upward\npullback from the down move in the two circles. Sometimes pullbacks keep\ngoing, and the price resumes the uptrend — although hardly ever after break-\ning the bottom band like this one. To detect head fakes, use Bollinger bands\nwith other confirming indicators, especially momentum indicators like the rel-\native strength index and MACD (Chapter 12).\n\nApplying Stops with Average\nTrue Range Bands\n\nPas\n\nBollinger bands are not generally used to set stops. The bands are equidis-\ntant from the moving average, so an upside breakout has the same statisti-\ncal strength as a downside breakout. When you have a strongly trending\nsecurity, you can’t make a reversal move face a tougher breakout test — but\nlogically, you should. I call it a “prove it” test. Given that false breakouts are\nso common, this reason makes it necessary and sufficient for you to consider\nanother type of band, as observed by system designer Steve Notis.\n\nTo use a band for a stop, you want the band to be asymmetrical, so that in an\nuptrend, a down move has to be more severe than recent up moves to trigger\nyour stop. But you can’t filter Bollinger bands. Instead of using the standard\ndeviation to form the upper and lower bands, you can use a version of the\naverage true range (ATR). You can adjust the ATR as follows so that a break-\nout “proves” that it is statistically significant:\n\n Uptrend: Widen the distance of the lower band from the average.\n\n Downtrend: Widen the distance of the upper band from the average.\n\nThe greater width of one of the bands from the center moving average sepa-\nrates corrective moves from real reversals. This move can become labor\nintensive, not least because before you can widen either band, you must be\nsure of the trend direction.\n\nIn Figure 14-6, the price makes a bottom on the left-hand side and starts an up\nmove. The centerline is a moving average of the median price, or the average\nof the high, low, and close. The bands are formed by taking a moving average\nof the ATR and adding and subtracting it from the moving average.\n\nThis process creates an ATR test that a breakout has to pass to qualify as a\n\ntrue breakout. When the price starts a new uptrend, the price breaking the\nupper band confirms that you have identified the trend correctly.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Accordingly,\nyou widen the lower band by adding a percentage of the ATR to it. On the\nchart in Figure 14-6, the lower band is 50 percent wider than the upper band\n(it is 150 percent of the ATR). The last bar on the chart breaks the band, just\nafter the support line is broken. This is no mere retracement! You have a\ndouble breakout of the trend (support) plus a volatility breakout (ATR band).\n\nAs with Bollinger bands, a breakout above the upper band signals continu-\nation, but because breakouts are a sign of abnormally high volatility, you\ncan usually count on a pullback to the median. A longer-term position trader\nwould buy at the left-hand low and hold the break of the support line.

Significant prices are those that exceed the\nhigh or low of a recent trading range by a specified amount. You ignore minor\nmoves — literally. You don’t even record them on your chart. The result is\nfiltered price action. You don’t see a price move in the opposite direction of\nthe current trend until it’s meaningful, according to a rule you set yourself, so\nthat you can have confidence when a reversal signal is accurate.\n\nYou can also easily identify patterns on point-and-figure charts, especially\nsupport and resistance, and therefore, breakouts of support and resistance.\nPoint-and-figure charts look very different from standard bar charts, but after\nyou get used to them, you may find their directness and simplicity addictive.\n\nP&F charting emphasizes a shift in the price range as the basis of trading deci-\nsions, which is in keeping with the idea of measuring crowd behavior (see\nChapter 3). The purpose of the display method is to filter out irrelevant prices\nto isolate the trends.\n\nP&F analysis is suitable for trading that has a medium- to long-term holding\nperiod — weeks and months. The only way to know whether point-and-figure\ncharting is for you is to try it out on your chosen securities and see what\ngains you would’ve made, how many trades it requires of you, and so on. In\ngeneral, point-and-figure charting on a daily basis is the easiest technique\n\nof all and the best way for a beginner to start getting a feel for making rule-\nbased trading decisions. So what are you waiting for? This chapter is ready to\nguide you through what you need to know about point-and-figure charting.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But all charts contain a lot of data that isn’t meaningful —\nit’s filler or noise. For example, a standard bar chart (see Chapter 6) has an\nentry every day, even when nothing interesting happened. What if you could\nisolate just the juicy nuggets of price information and forgo the noise?\n\nDisplaying the price only when it makes a significant move is the essence of\npoint-and-figure charting. If nothing noteworthy happened on a particular day,\nyou put nothing on the chart. Because chart events like a breakout or reversal\noften follow real-world events (breaking news, for example), you can consider\nthe point-and-figure chart to be event driven.\n\nThe point-and-figure method of displaying data takes time to get used to. Some\npeople think that it looks weird, while others take to it like a duck to water.\nStick with me through this section, and by the end, you'll have the hang of it.\n\nPutting each move into a column\n\nIn point-and-figure charting, you put a price entry on the chart only if the\nprice is higher than the previous high by a certain amount or lower than the\nprevious low by a certain amount.\n\nWhen a price is going sideways — not making a new high or low — nothing is\nhappening in the security, and you have nothing worth entering on the chart.\n\nFor a new high that is higher than the previous high, you enter a dot or an\n\nX. For a new low that is lower than the previous low, you enter a dot or an\n\nO. You place the Xs and Os in a column that represents a continuous move,\neither up or down. The point-and-figure chart contains alternating columns of\nXs and Os, where each column is a move. A column of Xs is an up move and\n\na column of Os is a down move. Each X column is reserved for rising prices\nand each O column is reserved for falling prices. You can’t put an X into an O\ncolumn or an O into an X column.\n\nSay you're considering a security whose price has been rising. The high\ntoday is $9. You start a new chart and enter an X next to the $9 label on the\nvertical axis, as I’ve done in Figure 15-1. The next day, the price high is $10,\nso you enter an X in the same column at the $10 level. When the high reaches\n$12 the next day, you add two Xs to denote the move from yesterday’s $10\n\nto today’s $12. You keep adding Xs in the same column until the price climb\nends. In the example in Figure 15-1, the price stops climbing at $13. You see a\ncolumn of Xs that represents the price rise from $9 to $13 in a single move.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

(I tell you more about this topic in a\nminute in the “Defining box size” section; for now, consider that the new low\nsuffices to consider that the up move is over.) Figure 15-1 tells you that the\nnew low came at $10. You now expect the next entry to be another O where\nthe question mark is placed on the chart. Whatever happens next, the forma-\ntion of anew column alerts you to a change in the price dynamics.\n\nEach column on the chart represents an up move or a down move, regardless\nof time. On a daily chart, a column can represent 2 days, 10 days, 100 days, or\nany other number of days. You start a new column only when the last direc-\ntional move is over. On the chart in Figure 15-1, you have an up move from $9\nto $13 and thus five Xs, but that doesn’t mean it took five days. It may have\ntaken 30 days, because on days showing no new high, you skipped over that\nprice data and did not make a chart entry.\n\nMost P&F software exhibits dates at the bottom of the chart along the horizon-\ntal axis. These dates aren’t spaced evenly at regular intervals because they are\nin the usual chart format. In fact, the dates are there only for convenience —\nthey don’t actually measure time because in point-and-figure charting, the date\nis irrelevant and only price action matters.\n\nDealing with box size\n\nThe box size is the minimum amount that the security needs to move above\nthe recent highest high (marked by the last X) or below the lowest low\n(marked by the last O) before another entry is made on the chart. The follow-\ning sections discuss how to get the box size right in P&F charting.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

In the days when traders used actual\ngraph paper, they filled in the little boxes of the grid with the Os and Xs set at\nsome appropriate dollar amount, such as $.50 or $1. In futures markets, trad-\ners use the number of points corresponding to dollar amounts. The choice of\nspacing on the vertical axis is still called the box size, even if you’re using a\ncomputer program and not actual graph paper.\n\nWhen your security has a highest high of $10, for example, and it regularly\nvaries by $.50 per day, you might set your box size at $1. If today’s new high\nis $12, you acknowledge that this is a price extreme — four times the usual\ndaily trading range — and deserves a new X in the X column. In fact, in this\ncase, the new high is a full $2 over the last high, so you fill in two $1 boxes\nwith the X notation. What happens if the price changes by $.98? Nothing. The\nnew price is close to the box size of $1, but close doesn’t count.\n\nChoosing a box size\n\nWhen you select a small box size, you're asking to see a lot of detail, includ-\ning small retracements. By increasing the box size, you're filtering out filler\ndata, just like when you make a rule that requires a price to cross a moving\naverage by x percent (see Chapter 12 for a discussion of filtering).\n\nThe smaller the box, the more sensitive the chart is to price changes. The\nbigger the box, the less sensitive the chart is. If you’re risk averse, you may\nprefer a small box size. If you want to see the big picture, you prefer a bigger\nbox. Table 15-1 contains the standard box-size guidelines.\n\nTable 15-1 Approximate Guidelines for Box Size\nSecurity Price Box Size\n$5-20 $.50\n$20-100 $1\n$100-200 $2\n$200-300 $4\n$300—400 $6\n\nComputer charting programs adjust the box size to fit the screen if you leave the\nprogram in default mode. You may wind up with a box size of $.67 or some other\narbitrary number. Box size is too important to leave to a program, because many\nother traders use a standard round-number box, like $.50 or $1. Besides, software\nadjusts box size to accommodate the amount of data you select, so you get dif-\nferent point-and-figure charts (and hypothetical trading decisions), depending on\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

The software uses the box size that fits the highest\nrange in the data series in order to get everything on one chart. But the trading\nrange of any single security changes over time, and you want to take note of that\nrather than let software obscure the changing range. If you use P&F charting soft-\nware, fix the box size so you know whether the range is expanding — the columns\nof Xs and Os get taller — or contracting — or whether the columns get shorter\nand there are more of them.\n\nAdding the reversal amount to the picture\n\nThe purpose of the box size (see earlier section on this topic) is to note\n\na significant change in price. But how do you know how far a price has to\nmove below the X (upward) column to warrant starting an O (downward)\ncolumn? For that, you establish a second criterion, the reversal amount. The\ntraditional reversal amount is three boxes. If your box is $1 and you’re now\nin a rising X column, you have to get a new low that is $3 lower than the low\ntoday to start anew O (downward) column.\n\nYou can backtest a variety of box sizes and reversal amounts to arrive at the\nbest numbers to use for any particular security. As a general rule, though,\npoint-and-figure chartists recommend sticking to the three-box rule for rever-\nsals and adopting different box sizes for chart entries, depending on the abso-\nlute level of the prices.\n\nA box size of $4, the appropriate box for a security selling over $200, with a\nthree-box reversal, works out to $12. If you have 100 shares, you would exit on\na reversal of at least $1,200, which is a fairly hefty sum of money. If you use the\nthree-box reversal as a stop level (see Chapter 5 for stops), you have to accept\nthat big of a loss when the price goes against you. If you judge that $1,200 is\ntoo big a loss to take on a single position, you can trade a smaller number of\nshares (an odd-lot) or trade a cheaper security.\n\nDrawing the daily chart\n\nTo draw the chart, every day you check the highest high and lowest low of\nthe day. Is the price higher than the previous high by $1? If so, enter another\nX above the last X in the column. Is the low lower than today’s low by $1?\nEnter nothing. By $2? Again, enter nothing. By $3? Aha! That’s three boxes\nworth, the reversal amount, and you start a new column, entering the O at\n\na level $3 below the last X. Because it’s a reversal, now you expect the next\nentry to be one box lower. The next day, is the low price lower than yester-\nday by $1? If so, enter another O. If it’s higher, it has to be higher than today’s\nhigh by $3 to abandon the falling-price O column.\n\nIf you see a lot of reversal columns that contain only one entry, chances are\nyour box size is too small — or your reversal amount is wrong.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

This is an outside day (see Chapter 6).\nThe new low trumps the new high, and you should start a new column of Os.\nAfter all, you’re looking for a threat to the trend (and your pocketbook). A new\nlow by the reversal amount constitutes a serious threat.\n\nApplying Patterns\n\nPatterns pop out on point-and-figure charts. Some of the most common pat-\nterns include support and resistance, but also simple patterns like double\nand triple tops and bottoms appear. This section outlines how you can use\nthese common point-and-figure chart patterns.\n\nSupport and resistance\n\nPoint-and-figure charting offers two versions of support and resistance: The\nhorizontal historic-level version | describe in Chapter 5 and the conventional\nversion that slopes along a series of highs or low, which you can discover in\nChapter 10.1 show you how to approach both types when using point-and-\nfigure charting in the following sections.\n\nHorizontal support and resistance\n\nIn Chapter 5, I talk about the historic high or low. Traders remember the\nhighest high ever or the lowest low in three months as benchmarks when the\nprice approaches the same level. In point-and-figure charting, the horizontal\nline that you draw to mark the top or bottom of columns becomes a kind of\nrecent-history support or resistance. Therefore, you often get a series of col-\numns that all end at a floor or a ceiling, regardless of whether they’re Xs or\nOs. Floors and ceilings are very handy both for spotting a breakout and set-\nting a stop (see Chapter 5 for a discussion of stops).\n\nIn Figure 15-2, the top-left chart shows a breakout X above the resistance\nline. Using conventional charting, you wouldn’t have known that line was\nthere unless you were on the lookout for historic highs and lows. But point-\nand-figure chartists draw them all the time to denote where supply becomes\nabundant or demand falls short, halting a price rise.\n\nConventional support and resistance\n\nOn a standard bar chart (see Chapter 6), you draw a support line along a\nseries of lows or a resistance line along a series of highs. These lines almost\nalways have a slope that describes the trend and are hardly ever horizontal\nexcept in a consolidation. You can draw sloping support and resistance lines\non point-and-figure charts, too.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

When bulls fail to get a breakout above the established high,\nit’s a pretty good sign that sellers are happy to unload the security at that\nprice. When you get more than one low at about the same level, it’s a double\nor triple bottom, where buyers think it’s a bargain, and the price is likely to\nrise. See Chapter 9 for a discussion of double and triple tops and bottoms.\n\nA double or triple top or bottom can be either a reversal pattern or a continu-\nation pattern in point-and-figure charting, depending on the behavior of the\nopposite-direction columns. In conventional time-based bar charting, you\nhave to wait for confirmation of these patterns — chewing up time. Point-and-\nfigure, therefore, can speed up the process of helping you decide whether\nyou're getting a reversal or a continuation.\n\nIn regular bar charting, a confirmed double top has a high probability of\nresulting in a price drop. A qualified double bottom leads to a price rise.\nThey’re reversal patterns, which you can see in chart form in Figure 15-2. In\npoint-and-figure, however, chartists find that in an uptrend of Xs, if the inter-\nvening Os are on a rising line (the lowest low in the last O column isn’t as low\nas the lowest low in the previous O column), a double top may turn into a\ntriple top and then an upside breakout — in other words, a continuation pat-\ntern. This configuration is shown in the fourth pattern in Figure 15-2. If the\nopposite-direction columns are horizontal, though, the traditional reversal\ninterpretation is probably correct.\n\nProjecting Prices after a Breakout\n\nPas\n\nPoint-and-figure chartists forecast prices after a breakout by using the box\ncount, either vertically or horizontally. However, vertical projections work\nmore often than horizontal projections. The following sections discuss how\nto make your own forecasts based on point-and-figure chart breakouts.\n\nIn point-and-figure charting, you buy when the new price surpasses the highest X\nin the previous X column, and you sell when the new price surpasses the lowest\nlow O in the previous O column. When the price surpasses a previous high or\nlow, you have a breakout. (See Chapter 10 for a full discussion of breakouts.)\n\nUsing vertical price projection\nSay that your security has just made a double or triple top breakout like the\n\none shown in Figure 15-2. You want to know how high the price will go. Or\nyour security has fallen to a new low but is now rising up off it. You want to\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Because other \nindicators are time based, how can this merger be done?\nHere’s how you can use point-and-figure charting along with other indicators \nI mention in this book:\n \n✓ Moving averages: You use the price at the center of each column in \ncalculating a moving average in P&F charts, instead of the usual method \nof averaging prices over a fixed number of periods. Thus you are using \nthe average price per reversal. If the moving average shows that you had \na downtrend and now you get a new column of Xs that rises over the \nmoving average, you have more confidence that the Xs really do imply a \nrising trend and thus a safer buy signal.\n \n✓ Parabolic stop-and-reverse indicator: The parabolic stop-and-reverse \n(SAR) indicator delivers a speedier reversal than waiting for a new column \nof Xs or Os. (See Chapter 5.) The parabolic SAR has the advantage of tight-\nening your stop as the momentum of a price move decelerates.\n \n✓ Bollinger bands: Data displayed in the P&F format can’t display momen-\ntum and thus overbought or oversold, a shortcoming that can be \npartly addressed by applying Bollinger bands (see Chapter 14). If your \ncolumns of Xs persist in pressing against the top of the band and some-\ntimes breaking it, you have confirmation of the uptrend. When the next \ncolumn of Os crosses the centerline (a simple moving average) to the \ndownside, you expect a swing all the way to the bottom band.\n \n Finally, Bollinger bands are wide apart when volatility is high, and they \n“squeeze” narrower as volatility dissipates and prices become con-\ngested. In a congestion, P&F prices are in a series of short columns that \nyou can’t trust to deliver a reliable buy-or-sell signal. When you see the \nshort columns together with the narrow Bollinger band, you can guess \nthat the market is fickle — it’s not trending, and you should go find \nsomething else to trade.\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n[Formulas: $10 + $15]",

Technical heads argue over which category to file any particu-\nlar indicator. Relative strength, for example, is a momentum concept that is\nused to measure market sentiment (overbought or oversold).\n\nThe key point is that using one indicator increases profits and lowers losses.\nCombining two indicators works even better. You can add as many indicators\nand trading rules to your charts as you can hold in your head or program\ninto your computer.\n\nThis chapter surveys some combinations of techniques and offers guidance\non the process of putting techniques together to forge a systematic approach\nto trading. Before you get to full-scale trading systems (see Chapter 17),\nthough, you need to examine the compatibility of indicators. You also need\nto know that adding indicators multiplies the difficulty of the trading deci-\nsion. That’s where this chapter comes in handy.\n\nStanding the Test of Time: Simple Ideas\n\nMany professional traders make a living by applying the same simple indica-\ntors and the same simple rules, over and over again, on the same small set\nof securities. “It can’t be that easy!” you think. But it is. Professionals have a\nsuperhuman ability to focus on a single narrow set of circumstances. They\nknow from experience that the indicator and rule produce a profit most of\nthe time. If it fails to produce a profit this time, too bad. They put it behind\nthem and move on to the next trade.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "2 68 Part V: Flying with Dynamic Analysis\n\nPas\n\nOne of the oldest trading concepts is also one of the simplest — Richard\nDonchian’s 5/20 system, which uses a trend-following principle. You buy\nwhen the 5-day moving average crosses above the 20-day moving average\nand sell when the closing price crosses below the 5-day moving average.\nBoth the buy-and-sell crossover signals are qualified according to additional\nfiltering criteria, specifically that a crossover has to exceed the extent of the\nprevious crossover in the same direction, proving its street credentials, so to\nspeak. (See Chapter 12 for information on moving averages and filtering.)\n\nAnother simple but effective one-rule concept is to buy when the price moves\nabove the range established in the first x number of minutes of trading. Its\ninventor, Toby Crabel, calls this strategy the opening range breakout. The\nopening range breakout is a volatility breakout setup (see the section on\n“Evaluating Efficient Entries and Ruthless Exits: Setups” later in the chapter).\nWith the opening range breakout, you can improve the odds of getting a suc-\ncessful trade by adding one or more confirmation qualifiers, such as:\n\nThe preceding bar was an inside day or doji (see Chapter 8).\n\nThe x-minute opening range over the past three to ten days was narrowing\n(see Chapter 14).\n\nThe opening is a gap from the day before (see Chapter 7).\n\nAs the two classic cases illustrate, even the simplest trading rule based on a\nsingle indicator uses confirming filters, patterns, or another indicator.\n\nBut which two indicators should you choose? Or should you choose three, or\nfour, or more? Because technical analysis has produced thousands of stand-\nalone indicators and patterns, the number of possible combinations and per-\nmutations is humungous. By the time you add time constraints, such as “Buy\n30 minutes after the open (or high or low or close) if x, y, and z occur,” the\nnumber of potential trading regimes is in the millions.\n\nThe key reason for adding confirming indicators is to overcome the incon-\nvenient little fact that every indicator fails some of the time. By requiring\na second indicator that gives the same buy or sell signal, you increase the\nprobability that your trades are profitable.\n\nAs I say in Chapter 5, you must take five steps in planning and managing the\ntrade. At each step you have to decide which indicators to follow, but you\ndon’t have to use the same indicators for each step. Your entry rule can be\nbased on one set of indicators that is different from the set of indicators you\nuse to exit. You can change your indicator set at any time if your eye spots\nsomething on the chart that normally you wouldn’t use but is too big and obvi-\nous to neglect. You can even change your stop-loss rules, either the initial stop\nwhen the trade is young or the trailing stop as the trade progresses — as long\nas you have an indicator-based reason and you still have a stop at all times.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

But what if the down-cross doesn’t occur until\nafter you have started taking losses?\n\nAnother big issue arises after you have been stopped out or taken the preset\nprofit. How do you know whether to reenter? Do you use the same or differ-\nent rules to reenter in the same-direction trade? I have asked this question\nof about 30 high-level system designers and traders. About half say that the\nindicators and rules for reentry are the same as for the entry and about half\nsay that you should have a different set of indicators and rules for reentry.\n\nAdding a new indicator piles on complexity and can get tricky. When you com-\nbine indicators, sometimes they contradict one another. One indicator says\nbuy, while a different indicator says sell. This conflict is very common.\n\nThe price of your security, for example, crossed above its moving average\nand you bought it. The trend has been in place for a while. Now a momentum\nindicator like RSI or MACD is signaling that the security is overbought and\nwill retrace. You don’t know if the retracement will be minor or become a full-\nblown reversal. You know that the moving average lags the price action — no\nhelp there. Do you accept the sell signal from the swing indicator?\n\nNo single correct answer exists. Sometimes momentum indicators are wrong,\nand the retracement doesn’t occur at all, leaving you with the problem of\nwhere to reenter your trend, which is running away without you. But even\nafter the most exhaustive backtesting and observation, you still are wrong\nsome of the time no matter which decision you make. The purpose of com-\nbining indicators is to improve the odds of being right about the next price\nmove, but you will never be right 100 percent of the time.\n\nThe only way to know whether two or more indicators work well together is to\nbacktest them together, with the trading rules meticulously stipulated. Testing\na single indicator is easy. Testing multiple indicators and rules for various\ncontingencies is hard work and often raises more questions than it answers.\nAnd many people don’t have the time or aptitude for backtesting. In that case,\nat the least take the time to observe the indicators on the chart and estimate\nhow well they work together. After reading the following section and some\npractice, you should be able to see matching signals, divergences, support\nand resistance, and patterns. Expert traders say, “Trade what you see on the\nchart,” and it’s good advice.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Making that\nchoice establishes whether you are a trend-follower or a swing trader, or if\nyou are a swing trader through and through, how fast and how frequently\nyou want to trade.\n\nSwitching indicators, even in mid-trade, is okay if you see something compel-\nling on the chart — as long as you appreciate that you’re changing your trad-\ning plan. To override your ruling concept is like abandoning your date at the\nprom when you spot a prettier girl. You can’t evaluate an indicator properly if\nyou don’t apply it consistently, and you can’t evaluate your skills as a trader\nif you switch focus. But at the same time, your ultimate purpose in trading is\nto make money, not to prove that your indicators are valid. Just be aware that\nyou may be taking more risk when you adopt a new technique that you have\nnot used before or backtested. If set properly, your stop can save you if your\nembrace of a new indicator goes south.\n\nFor example, your security may be on a rising trend when suddenly you\nnotice a candlestick, like a hanging man (see Chapter 8), that is a big warning\nand decide to exit early even though your indicators are not signaling a sell\nand your stop is still far away.\n\nFigure 16-1 shows another example. In this case, say you decide to use the\nDonchian 5/20-day moving average crossover. You get a sell signal. A little\nlater, the price bounces and you get a buy signal followed in a few weeks by\nanother sell signal — a whipsaw. But before then, you can’t avoid noticing\nthe double top, even though pattern recognition is not one of the indicators\nin your toolkit. But it’s the gorilla in the room on this chart, so you run right\nout and research it. The rule in double-top analysis is that after the confir-\nmation point is reached, the price often pulls back above it before resuming\nthe downtrend, giving you a better opportunity to go short. This time you\nfollow the double-top rule and avoid the moving average-generated whipsaw.\nPattern recognition served you well.\n\nA wide knowledge of indicators can help make your trading more adaptive and\nflexible. But it’s human nature that when you have a hammer, everything looks\nlike a nail. Beware of imagining double tops on every chart after the successful\ntrade exemplified in Figure 16-1 and beware of believing that every double top\ndelivers this outcome. A series of successful trades on a single indicator doesn’t\nmake it a magic indicator that always works. I can’t say it often enough — no\nindicator works all the time.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You can say to yourself, for example, that the first\nindicator (three higher highs with three higher lows plus break of resistance)\ngives you a 25 percent expectancy that the price is going to rise farther. The\ngap gives you another 25 percent. The cross of the 20-day moving averages\ngives you a further 25 percent.

You can estimate the\nchance of any particular trade being successful by subtracting the margin of\nerror from the historical success rate from your backtests, assuming that you\ndid a very large backtest. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of backtests.) The\nmargin of error is a statistical concept that programmers are just starting to\ninclude in technical analysis software. Say that a particular set of indicator-\nbased rules delivered 80 percent profitable trades over a large number of\nhypothetical trades on historical data. Your margin of error is 20 percent,\nmeaning that the rule-based trade delivers a loss 20 percent of the time.\n\nMath whizzes say that if a technique works 80 percent of the time on, say, Blue\nWidget over a gazillion trials, it should work the same (or nearly the same) on\nPink Widget. In other words, the probability of the outcome is a function of the\nstatistics — and independent of the quality or character of the security. Non-\nmathematicians have a hard time swallowing this one. You can show identi-\ncal backtest results for Blue Widget and Pink Widget, but feel in your bones\nthat you should increase the margin of error judgmentally when trading Pink\nWidget. Don’t dismiss instincts like this one. Maybe Pink Widget has lower\nliquidity or some other characteristic that didn’t throw up a hairball in the\nbacktest but is still vulnerable to doing it someday.\n\nDeveloping a positive expectancy of gain by having your indicators pass suc-\ncessive tests is not the same thing as having found a “high probability trade.”\nThere is no such thing as a high-probability trade. Trades can go wrong because\nof events that you cannot foresee or control. To speak of high-probability trades\nis to buy into the huckster and con man mindset. The only time to use the high-\nprobability label is when you fix the stop and target at trade entry. The high\nprobability applies to the stop as well as the target.\n\nEnhancing positive expectancy by entering\ngradually and exiting at once\n\nFigure 16-5 discusses the trade in terms of a single purchase and sale. In\npractice, you can enhance profitability by scaling into the trade (Step 3 of\n\nthe trading plan outline). To scale into the trade means to add to the position\nas each confirmation appears. Say you have $5,000 to place on this secu-\n\nrity. You start by placing a portion of that capital ($1,000) when the first or\nsecond indicator signals buy. Then you place additional lots of $1,000 as each\nbenchmark is reached, until you have 100 percent of the capital allocated to\nthe trade. One clear place to add more to the trade is at Point 7, where the\nprice tests support and bounces off it to the upside.\n\nIn Figure 16-5, the price breaks below the support line and also crosses below\n\nthe 20-day moving average, and the two indicators in the top and bottom win-\ndows turn downward. Chances are this up move is over. You exit as shown.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

This chart doesn’t \nshow a trailing stop-loss line, but in practice, this trend was fairly long last-\ning, and a trailing stop, if hit, would still have resulted in a nice gain.\nEvaluating Efficient Entries \nand Ruthless Exits: Setups\nSetup trading is a form of swing trading that’s very popular today. A setup is \na particular configuration of bars, usually with one or two other confirming \nconditions like a pattern or an indicator, that delivers an expected outcome \nin a high proportion of trades. The opening range breakout I describe in the \n“Standing the Test of Time: Simple Ideas” section earlier in the chapter is an \nexcellent example of a setup. Candlestick trading can be considered setup \ntrading, too (see Chapter 8).\nSetups usually have catchy names (like pinball and coiled spring). Do these \nsetups work? If you identify the setup correctly, yes, the price does often \nbehave in the predicted manner. Unfortunately, statistics on exactly what \npercentage of the time they do work don’t exist, but experienced setup trad-\ners say that setups work often enough that early entry gives you an edge.\nEach setup identifies a specific market condition that can be explained in \nterms of market psychology. Setup analysis is promiscuous, borrowing from \nbar reading, pattern identification, and indicators. Setups are effective tools \nwhen you can read the supply and demand dynamics on the chart — you \ncan imagine what traders must be thinking, such as the predictable burst of \nbuying after a test of support. In general, you’re counting on the normal swing \nof Newtonian action-reaction and the principles of support and resistance.\nOne benefit of setup trading is that you can be out of the market until you \nspot a setup situation. You take no risk when you’re out of the market. Some \nsetup trades are intraday, where you enter and exit the trade on the same \nday. Other setup trades are more long lasting because they lead to authentic \ntrends that you stick to until your exit rules or stop is hit. In the next section, \nI describe some aspects of trading setups.\nStarting off early\nA setup identifies the conditions that precede and accompany a price move, \ngiving you a head start in entering a trade. When you correctly identify the \nsetup, the price goes in your direction immediately. And when a strong move \nbegins, the first few days can account for 25 percent or more of the total \nmove. That’s the thrust or impulse aspect of new moves.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

As a general rule, your goal as a setup trader is to\ntake a profit bite out of a move without necessarily having a position over the\nentire move.\n\nEntering early in setup trading is in stark contrast to trend-following, where\nyou wait until the move has proved itself according to some definition of trend-\nedness before you take a position. In setup trading, you enter a position on the\nsame day or the next day as the chart event, whereas in trend-following,\n\nyou may not enter until several periods (usually days) later.\n\nEfficient entries are the hallmark of setup swing trading, but being quick on\nthe trigger doesn’t imply that the trader is a wild-eyed risk taker. Quite the\nopposite. Risk management is the key feature of setup swing trading and thus\nappropriate for beginners. You must\n\nv Never give up profits by sitting out a retracement (as you often do when\ntrend-following).\n\nAbsolutely, positively use stops and keep them updated.\n\nExiting the setup game\n\nFor the most part, you do not scale into and out of setup trades. You determine\nthe amount to trade only once. The next part of the trade — the exit —\nborrows a page from the professional playbook: Ruthless stops. The playbook\noffers the following tips:\n\nIf the setup is a dud — it fails or you have not identified it right — you\nneed a stop at a level of loss that you can tolerate. (See Chapter 5 on\nstops.) All good traders use stops but if you have a problem obeying\nyour stops, setup trading might be for you. You go broke fast without\nstops, and recognizing that, force yourself to use them.\n\nIf the setup succeeds, you keep moving your stop upward to secure\neach new level of gain as it occurs. Generally you hold until the price\nmoves against you by some specified amount. Sometimes setups are so\nshort lived that an initial stop is all you need and you are not in the trade\nlong enough to use a trailing stop. Setup trading can be hit and run.\n\nWorking hard while trading like a pro\n\nHere’s the catch: Not every setup works every time, and you have to adopt\nthe professional’s attitude to a losing trade — get out of the trade and move\non to the next one.

With\na small universe of securities, you'd have to memorize a dozen setups if\nyou want to be in the market most or all of the time.

A complete trading\nsystem can take years of full-time work to develop (or hundreds of thousands\nof dollars to have custom built). Third, after you get started, it’s hard to stop.\nYou can always find one more contingency you want to cover or one more\ntechnique to try out. And even if you have the scientific mind-set to do this\ncomplex work, you may not have the right mentality to place the trades in\nreal time. The technical landscape is littered with engineers turned system\ndesigners who can’t trade their way out of a paper bag.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Finally, the market changes. By \nthis I mean that until traders can make indicators instantly adaptive to chang-\ning volatility, the human mind is still a faster and more accurate computer \nthan a computer. Where robots do excel is in speed of execution, which can \nbe critical in trading on news releases and in arbitrage models.\nHaving just poured cold water on the idea of building a system, why include \nthis chapter at all? Two reasons. First, building a system forces you to exam-\nine indicator effectiveness and reliability in a strict and fact-based way. It \nalso opens the door to refining your money-management rules, which often \nyields as much or more profit than replacing indicators or adjusting indicator \nparameters. Second, the process is a scientific one. You create a hypothesis, \nyou test it, and you get results that can be evaluated to refine the hypothesis \nfor another round of tests. The scientific process is disciplined. If you aren’t \nscientifically trained or oriented, having a system is invaluable to help you \ndiscard sloppy thinking, unwarranted assumptions, and general bias.\nDefining a Trading System\nThe term trading system has different meanings to different people. Systematic \ntrading can be as simple as a single indicator and a stop-loss rule (for more \non these topics see Chapters 4 and 16). In fact, most folks in the technical \nanalysis field now refer to any trading regime as a system, even when it \ndoesn’t meet the strict requirement of full automation. In this chapter, I \nspeak of a trading system in the strictest sense — every decision is dictated in \nadvance by the indicators and trading rules that you set down.\nA trading system is built, block by block, by accumulating trading rules to \nconvert indicators or other data inputs into buy/sell signals. A trading system \nbecomes a robot when it executes the trades as well as determines them. \nThese decisions include position size and other aspects of the trading plan. \nInstead of laboriously figuring out how many shares of Blue Widget to buy or \nsell depending on your changing risk preference and market volatility (see \nChapter 16), the machine does it for you. Instead of selecting from among a \nmenu of indicators and trading rules to reenter after a stop or target is hit, \nthe machine does it for you.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "285\n Chapter 17: Considering a Trading System\nSuper systems\nAlgorithmic trading is the fusion of technical \nanalysis with efficient order entry, and banks \nand fund managers initially used this method \nto get an advantage in execution speed. One \nsubset consists of “high-frequency” traders \nwhose machines can place trades at literally \nthe speed of light (or just under it), whereas the \nhuman trader may take as long as five or ten \nseconds to make a trading decision after the \nrelease of news or the appearance of a trading \nopportunity.\nInformation input needs to be as fast as output \n(the trade orders). Data and news vendors, for \na special price, make information available to \nbig institutions fractionally faster than to the \ngeneral public, too. The innate fairness of this \nfact is under question today. Algo trading may \naccount for as much as 75 percent of all securi-\nties trading in the U.S. Does this mean the trad-\ning game is rigged against the little guy? If you \nwant to do lightning-fast arbitrage, yes. If you \nare trend-following, maybe not. You can find \nany number of equally valid ways to trade the \nsame security.\nThe same problems arise in algo trading as in \nany system. Computer programming is deeply \nspecific. If the program fails to include every \ncontingency, it doesn’t have a brain that auto-\nmatically falls back to some kind of default \nmode. Data errors caused a “flash crash” in \nMay 2010, when the Dow fell 998 in under an \nhour and some $40 stocks were priced at $1. \nExperts doubt that this type of occurrence due \nto data error is the last.\nWhen a trade goes bad in some unprecedented \nway, humans have a fallback — they exit. But \ncomputers don’t watch TV or read newspa-\npers, so if the trade goes bad, it may have no \nprogrammed instructions on what to do until \nafter the event starts being reflected in prices. \nMarkets are notoriously slow to respond to \nevent shocks. This is one time the human is \nfaster.\nThe idea of automating trading is not innately \nwrong. After all, the equivalent of robots can fly \nan airplane and even land it. But the mechani-\ncal and electronic contingency planning under-\nlying avionics is vast and has taken decades, \nand superlative as it is, would still not be able \nto land a very large plane on the Hudson River \nafter a bird strike. At a guess, engineers are \nworking on it.\nAlgo trading is newer and presumably less far \nadvanced than avionics, although the big insti-\ntutions aren’t disclosing information on their \ntop-secret systems. We can draw inferences, \nthough. First, big institutions have made big \ninvestments in algo trading that are deliver-\ning a big payoff. In theory, you could duplicate \nthe effort in every way except high-frequency \ntrading (unless you’re willing also to pay for \nadvance information) and market making — \noffering a two-way price to any comer for any \nsize trade.\nThe second deduction is that vendors of auto-\nmated systems or robots have almost certainly \nnot put hundreds of million of dollars into the \ndesign. If they had, they wouldn’t be promot-\ning it to you for $500 or $5,000. It would literally \nbe worth more than that. If the system were a \nfabulous design, they would sell it to a big insti-\ntution for millions. A third flaw in retail-level \nsystems and robots is that the designer has \nembedded into it his own trading philosophy, \nby which I mean choice of indicators and risk \nappetite. Risk appetite is deeply personal, as I \ndiscuss in Chapter 16. The robot designer may \nbe willing to lose, say, $3 in an $8 initial buy \nwhereas your stop would be half that, or $1.50. \nBuying somebody else’s system is always going \nto disappoint.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You have already \nprovided directions ahead of time. As noted in a previous section, this \nreally cannot be done in full. Why? Because of what Nassim Nicholas \nTaleb named black swans — highly improbable events. Do traders ever \nget a new black swan? In other words, an event shock of a type never \nseen before? Maybe not. Human history is a long affair and perhaps \nnothing is ever really new. But programming every contingency into \ntrading rules is a vast and probably impossible task.\n \n✓ You follow the system without fail and without overriding the signals \nby using judgment. You take every trade that the system gives you, if \nonly because you never know which signal is the one that’ll generate the \njuicy profit. And in most systems, the successful backtest track record \ndepends on those big profits to offset many small losses.\nMeeting the designers\nBooks, articles, and Web sites abound on the \ntopic of technical trading systems, but who are \nthese gurus and system designers behind it \nall? Usually they’re self-trained “experts” (and \na surprising number are drop-outs). They have \nmastered one or more of the software pack-\nages designed solely for technical analysis. \nSometimes they program their own software. \nSystem designers are college math professors, \nengineers, medical doctors, economists, histo-\nrians, musicians, and practitioners of dozens of \nother lines of work. They run the gamut from bril-\nliant, insightful, and inspiring to self-important, \nargumentative, and petty (just like any other field).\nSystem designers are usually adept at math and \ncomputer programming, although often they’re \nnot very good traders, as they themselves may \nadmit. This reality isn’t really surprising because \nmath and computer programming are com-\nplex and intricate, while trading can be mind-\nbogglingly simple. Some designers start with \nprogramming and apply it to markets. Some start \nwith markets and use programming as a tool. It’s \namusing and intriguing that many technical trad-\ners barely passed high school algebra but take \nhome high six-figure profits, while many know-\nit-all system designers barely scrape by.\nWhy pay attention to system designers if they’re \nnot successful traders? Because you never \nknow when you’ll get a “Eureka!” moment and \ndiscover one indicator or one rule that makes all \nthe difference to your own trading performance.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You could spend years developing a comprehensive\nmechanical trading system, and many people do.\n\nFinding your place on the spectrum\n\nYou don’t have to embrace a fully mechanized computer program-based\nsystem to be a technical trader. But when you take losses, you start imag-\nining that some indicator, rule, or risk-management concept might have\nsaved you from the loss, so you think you should trade more systematically.\nYearning for more systematic trading is especially heartbreaking if you have\na spectacular winning year and then a losing one, and honestly can’t remem-\nber how you did it in the winning year.\n\nYou can start small. The first step is to review various indicators and their\nassociated trading rules. You can develop a buy/sell system fairly easily,\nchoosing indicators that seem logical and workable to you, and then adjust\nthe trading rules until you get a satisfactory hypothetical gain-and-loss profile.\nHypothetical is the right word because the chief reason to combine techniques\nin a trading system is to backtest indicators and trading rules to see how they\nwould have worked in the past. I discuss backtesting in Chapter 4. For all its\nfaults, backtesting is the only way to know whether an indicator works on\nyour security. After you find good indicators and rules, you can take them out\nfor a trial run in real time.\n\nDiscovering Why Mechanical\nSystems Fail\n\n\\NG/\ns\n\nTraining yourself to be a fully systematic trader is hard. The virtue of a well-\ndesigned trading system is that real-time results come in as the backtest leads\nyou to expect. The challenge of a mechanical trading system is ... you.\n\nYou have to trade exactly as the system dictates in order to duplicate test\nresults. For some, following every single system dictate is impossible. More\nthan one advanced system designer has had to give day-to-day control of\ntrading his system to another party, because he can’t help second-guessing\nit. Here are some ideas to help you sidestep some of the common pitfalls of\nmechanical trading systems.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "2 bs bf Part V: Flying with Dynamic Analysis\n\nav\n\nme\n\nFooling around with new ideas\n\nMechanical trading systems often fail because the trader can’t resist fiddling\nwith system components — either indicators or rules. Most traders’ systems\nare never really finished. They evolve as the trader experiments with new\nideas. The problem with new techniques is that people are impatient and try\nto fit the new idea into an existing system without fully backtesting it — or\nsometimes without backtesting it at all. Even experienced technical traders\n(late at night, after a few martinis) confess to reading about a new idea or\nhearing about it at a conference, and running right back home to trade it —\nusing actual money. Needless to say, this decision usually ends in tears.\n\nBacktesting until you're blue in the face\n\nTo find the “perfect” parameter for your indicator on your securities, you can\nspend countless hours backtesting. No sooner do you discover the ideal param-\neters than market volatility shifts, and the parameter is no longer optimum.\n\nA lot of indicator testing is just spinning your wheels. Indicator signal accu-\nracy isn’t 100 percent reliable to begin with, and fiddling with indicators never\ncures the accuracy problem. To add more indicators to “fix” the shortcomings\nof an existing indicator can result in excessive complexity without a commen-\nsurate improvement in accuracy. The one exception is if you’re able to make\nyour indicators more adaptive to market conditions, either arithmetically or\nwith filters or additional indicators.\n\nPerforming backtesting research while working toward a fully automated trading\nsystem has two virtues. You not only find out about indicator effectiveness and\nreliability, but you also get the opportunity to refine your money-management\nrules.\n\nBefore you spend a zillion hours adding or perfecting indicators, remember\nthat your goal isn’t to have the perfect indicator; your goal is to make money.\nYou spend time more wisely by perfecting your money-management rules\nthan by backtesting indicators until 2 a.m. Maybe nothing is wrong with your\nindicators — it may be your risk management that needs work. See Chapter 5\nfor a discussion of managing the trade.\n\nNot knowing your time frame\n\nNo rule is always right. Technical analysis contains rules that are valid in the\ncontext of their own time frame but work a whole lot less well in a different\ntime frame. Candlesticks (see Chapter 8), for example, tend to be most effec-\ntive in a short time frame (intraday or three to five days). If your preference\nis for trades lasting many months, you need indicators and risk-management\nrules that match up to that time frame.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Therefore, over a large number of trades, your\nprofit exceeds your losses. In this sense, fully systematic technical trading is a\nnumbers game.\n\nWhile a mechanical system imparts confidence in the eventual profit-and-loss\nprofile over some period of time, it has the drawback of occasionally being\nwrong on any single trade. Sometimes you can see the wrong trade coming,\nwhich makes you want to override the signal. To override technical signals\n\nis called discretion. Discretion is an innocent-sounding word, but in fact, it’s\ndynamite. To exercise discretion means to abandon your hard-earned, high-\nprobability systematic trading signals in favor of personal judgment.\n\nJust about every technical trader allows himself the luxury of discretion to\nsome extent. Professionals tend to exercise discretion a lot more than non-\nprofessionals. System purists point out that to override signals is to defeat\nthe purpose of having a system, while experienced traders say they have a\n“gut feel” about when a signal is bad.\n\nOverriding system signals is the main way that traders sabotage themselves.\nSabotage can take the form of overtrading (trading too often) or being unable\nto pull the trigger (indecisiveness), despite clear directions from your own\nsystem on what to do.\n\nOne of the chief reasons to use technical analysis and a systematic approach\nto trading is to give yourself a break from emotion. You may get away with a\n\nlittle overriding once in a while if you have good instincts, but if you do it on\n\nmore than a few rare occasions (in other words, more than a quarter of your\ntrades), you’re still a technical trader but no longer a system trader.\n\nBecause you can’t backtest judgment, the only way to evaluate discretionary\noverrides is to keep a diary and write down every override you want to do.\nEvery so often, go back and do an honest accounting of your judgment. A trad-\ning diary is a prose rendering of what you're seeing on the chart. Print out the\nchart and write your override idea on it. Then a few periods later, print out the\nchart showing what happened.\n\nA trading diary has many benefits:\n\nYou get ideas about additions to your system to overcome a shortcoming.\nThe diary becomes a wish list. Then while perusing the technical literature,\nyou can see a gem when you come across it — it’s the solution to an issue\non your wish list.\n\nYou may discover that your eye was detecting patterns that math-based\nindicators don’t catch.

A common finding is that you saw a continu-\ning trend because you wanted to see it and willfully ignored reversal\nwarnings from other indicators that were present on the chart.\n\nFollowing Big-Picture Rules\n\nPas\n\nHaving a positive expectancy of a gain is the key element of taking a trade\n(for more on this topic, see Chapter 16). Whether you're aiming for a full trad-\ning system or working more informally toward a more systematic approach,\nthis section gives you a short list of other considerations that have a big\nimpact on overall long-term profitability.\n\nStopping out versus the stop-and-reverse\n\nStopping out is a function of having met the maximum loss you're willing to\ntake. When the stop is hit, you have to decide whether to go short. Hitting\na stop doesn’t necessarily mean you want to reverse direction. Maybe you\nprefer to be out of the market altogether. As a practical matter, most indi-\n\nvidual traders are buy only and never go short.\n\nSome professionals are required by the rules of their firms to be in the\nmarket nearly all the time. They’re not “working” if they’re not trading.\nIndividuals don’t bear this burden. The flip side is that when you're out of\nthe market, you’re potentially missing an opportunity.\n\nTrading more than one security\n\nYou may have a valid and systematic way to trade a single security, but you\nstill face a high risk of loss due to a one-time catastrophe. The obvious solu-\ntion is to apply your systematic trading regime to a broader array of securi-\nties. Diversification reduces risk. When one security is falling in price, some\nother security is rising. A solid track record may require offsetting some\nlosses with gains in an inversely correlated or noncorrelated security.\n\nA good portfolio is diversified, and so are good trading systems. Using spread-\nsheet software, you can easily discover whether any two securities are corre-\nlated. Or you can plot both securities on the same chart and eyeball whether\nthey move in tandem. If they do, you may not have to dump one if you can find\nsomething else that is inversely correlated. The process of diversification is\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Portfolio optimization isn’t, strictly speaking, a\ntechnical analysis idea, but it’s a natural extension of the systematic approach\nto trading.\n\nOptimization may make for some strange bedfellows. Don’t reject a noncor-\nrelated security on fundamental grounds and pass up the opportunity to\nsmooth your earnings path. You don’t have to /ike the security to trade it\nsuccessfully. If you’re building an equity system and find that adding soybean\nfutures would reduce total system risk by half, then resign yourself to finding\nout how to trade soybean futures.\n\nThe same thing is true when you buy a system that requires you to trade\neach security of a basket of securities. If you cherry-pick the securities,\nyou're violating a core principle of the trading strategy — its diversification.\nDiversification may be its best feature on which results depend. See the sec-\ntion “Buying a Trading System” later in this chapter.\n\nDon’t forget that correlation or the absence of correlation is not written in\nstone. Two securities that are uncorrelated today may become highly corre-\nlated at some point in the future. Keep your correlation data updated.\n\nDon’t trade on too little capital\n\nA good system designer acknowledges that every system takes losses, and\nthe trader must have enough capital to remain standing afterward. If the\nsystem is capable of generating a $3,000 loss, the minimum capital required\nto trade the system is obviously higher than $3,000. You must know in\nadvance the amount of money you could lose on any single trade, named\n\na drawdown. Whether you're building your own system or buying one, you\nshould know the expected average drawdown and the expected maximum\ndrawdown.\n\nA standard rule is the Turtle rule — never risk more than 2 percent of total\ncapital on any single trade. In practice, the maximum drawdown many traders\naccept is 20 to 30 percent of capital, or ten times the conservative amount.\nYou can take only three or four worst-case losses in a row before you're out\nof business. Alas, this happens all too often because many brokers encourage\nnewcomers to trade with a small capital stake and high leverage.\n\nThis situation is particularly prevalent in foreign exchange trading, where you\ncan open an account with $1,000 and control (say) $20,000 in face value of con-\ntracts. If you applied the 2 percent rule using your true capital, your stop loss\nwould have to be $20, which is two points in a currency futures contract like\nthe Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar has an average daily range of about\n80 points, so you can forget about using the average true range (see Chapter 5)\nas a guide or indicator. The stop is obviously unrealistically tight — you will get\nstopped on the first random move. Instead of accepting that $1,000 is too little\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

One thousand dollars is simply too small an\namount.\n\nBuying a Trading System\n\n\\NG/\nss\n\nYou may see ads for trading systems that promise huge returns, practically\nno risk, and 80 percent accuracy on trade recommendations. Never forget\nthat if it sounds too good to be true, it’s not true. These trading systems are\nusually black boxes, which are systems that claim to select high-probability\ntrades but don’t reveal the trading rules and indicators that the system uses.\nThe promotional material may say that the inner workings of the system are\nself-adaptive (it’s a “neural network” that “learns” from its own mistakes) and\nis simply too complex to display.\n\nEven in the case of a self-adapting system, chances are that the system\nworked well on certain securities in a certain time frame in the past. But\nthat’s no guarantee that it is working today, will work in the future, will work\non the securities you like, or will work for you. You have to ask yourself why\nanyone would sell such a gold mine to you (at any price) instead of keeping it\nto himself. This section can help you avoid these too-good-to-be-true trading\nsystems and find one that can work for you.\n\nOvercoming phony track records\n\nIf you choose to buy a trading system, be aware that crooks and charlatans\nare found in the technical analysis business just as they are in any other\nbusiness. You see fraudulent track records, track records that mysteriously\ninclude only certain periods, and other chicanery. One trick is to adjust the\ntrack record by excluding the performance of securities in a portfolio when\nthey produce losses in the period, but to add them back when they produce\ngains. You can see through this financial foolishness by doing the following:\n\nGet disclosure of all the indicators and rules and verify results your-\nself by testing the system on the same historical data as the vendor’s\ntrack record. Make sure that you get data covering several years, and\nverify that the prices shown on the vendor’s track record actually\nexisted on each trade date.\n\nExamine the vendor’s actual brokerage statements, if possible. If the\nvendor doesn’t trade his own system and disclose real-life results, why\nnot? To be fair, some system designers may have some good reasons why\nhe doesn’t trade his own system, including a fondness for systems and\ndeep dislike of the trading process. Forget testimonials.

But this requirement applies equally to systems pub-\nlished in real time for same- or next-day day execution and systems that are\nonly curve-fitted to the past. Any 12-year-old can “fit” trading indicators to his-\ntorical data to produce 100 percent plus gains. A system that gives you trading\nsignals, with stops and targets, for tomorrow’s market and then calculates a\ntrack record on this outcome is a better bet.\n\nLooking under the hood\n\nOnly a few system vendors are crooks. Most are perfectly legit. Still, you want\nto get good value for money spent. You want\n\nOriginal ideas that are fully disclosed: In some cases, you could pay\n$250 to $5,000, only to get nothing more than a formula or two that you\ncould have acquired free from a book or the Internet. Often the vendor\nhas a near-religious attachment to some theory of price movements that\nis unproven or unprovable. You're welcome to share beliefs, but remem-\nber that technical analysis is an empirical exercise. If a belief doesn’t\ntranslate into profitable trading outcomes, why pay for it?\n\nScalability, which means that you can trade the system with a vari-\nable amount of money, including small amounts: Some trading systems\nrequire $50,000 or $100,000 in risk capital, amounts that are unrealisti-\ncally high for a newcomer. Usually the vendor has a good reason for\nrequiring so much capital — the system depends on diversification\namong many securities to get the published track record, for example,\nor the system tends to generate big drawdowns. If you buy a high-capital\nrequirement system but then allocate too little money to it, you must\ncherry-pick the trades, defeating the core concept.\n\nFully defined money-management rules: Most trading systems don’t\ncontain money-management rules and leave so much decision making\nup to the user that duplicating the advertised track record is virtually\nimpossible. At the very least, a trading system should tell you the rec-\nommended entry and exit (stop and target). An estimate of riskiness and\nadvice on adding and subtracting from positions would be nice, too.\n\nPicking the Tool, Not the Security\n\nSay that you just arrived from another planet, and you have no attachment\nto the concept of blue chip stocks and no difficulty seeing soybean futures in\nthe same light as IBM or the Swiss franc. To you, a security is a security, and\nyou care nothing about its underlying value or fundamental characteristics.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Using this mind-set, you're free to pick indicators and securities with-\nout regard for fuddy-duddy ideas of what is “proper.” Who knows? Maybe\nyour talent is for applying candlesticks to silver futures when you thought\nyou wanted to trade equities.\n\nAn accomplished technical trader can sit in front of a live price screen and\nbefore an hour is out, spot a method to trade the security. Even if he’s an\nequities trader and you’re showing him the Japanese yen, he can “read” the\nprice action. You can do this, too, if you focus on the tools and not on the\nsecurity.\n\nRather than seeking the best indicators to trade your favorite securities,\nconsider finding good indicators and matching the securities to them. If your\nonly goal is to make money by using technical indicators, why not reverse the\nusual order? The process goes by several different names, the most generic\nof which is scanning. You scan a universe of securities to find the ones that fit\nthe criteria you specify. Each technical analysis software package has its own\nname and method of scanning. Say you like the breakout concept. You can tell\nthe software to search or explore for every security in your database that has\njust risen above its 20-day moving average. Now you have a candidate list of\nsecurities to check out for other technical criteria.\n\nThat list will be too large, of course, so next you seek out the securities that\nhave other characteristics that suit your indicators and risk preference, such\nas a volatility filter.

We trade for many other reasons —\nto keep busy or to get the adrenaline rush of trading. If you trade for a living,\nkeeping your sanity isn’t a bad goal, either.

With thousands of securities\nto choose from, you are free to pick the ones you deem to be fundamentally\nsound, and time your trades from there.\n\nAfter you select your personal universe of securities, nearly every decision to\ninitiate a trade is based on chart events and not on news developments, funda-\nmental factors, or what some “expert” says. The chart contains all the informa-\ntion you need to make trading decisions. If information is truly important, the\nchart reflects it. Don’t forget to look at charts of the same security in different\ntime frames. The best of all possible worlds is when the price is moving in the\nsame direction in multiple time frames.\n\nI say nearly every decision because some wildly exceptional news shocks take\ntime to be reflected on the chart, like September 11, 2001 (after which the U.S.\nstock market closed for several days). Giant rare or unprecedented events like\nthis one will always trump the chart in the first few days or weeks. The best\nway to handle monumental historic events like these is to exit and wait.\n\nGefriend the Trend\n\nThe single-best way to know what’s happening and likely to happen to your\nsecurity’s price is to follow its trends. If you buy when an uptrend is form-\ning and sell when the uptrend peaks, you make money over the long run.\nRemember, your job is to define frend for yourself. A trend can be as small as\nsix bars on a ten-minute chart or hundreds of bars on a weekly chart.\n\nSometimes you can’t see a trend in the security you have selected. Patience\nis a virtue. If the security is usually trended, sit back and wait for the trend to\nappear. Staying out of the market when the security is not trending is okay —\nas is getting out of the trade temporarily when a pullback occurs. A security\npurchase isn’t a life-long commitment. You’re not being disloyal to your secu-\nrity if you sell it during a pullback.\n\nUnderstand That Vou Make Real Cash\nMoney Only When Vou Sell\n\nOn many occasions, securities rise and fall according to overall market senti-\nment and through no credit or fault of their own. Selling a falling security to\nlock in a profit or to stop a loss is common sense, even if you intend to buy\nthe very same security again when it starts moving up.\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "Chapter 18: Ten Secrets of the Top Technical Traders\n\nA policy of buy and hold is hardly ever the optimum long-term strategy. Many\npeople rode the bull market in the 1990s to great fortunes — on paper. Then\nwhen the crash came, they saw their net worth go down the drain. They were\nafraid to sell because they were holding onto the idea that to buy and hold is\nthe best rule, always and under every circumstance. Obviously, it’s not.\n\nTake Responsibility\n\nYou should have a reason for making every trade — the expectation of a posi-\ntive gain at a level of risk you can live with. If your broker, trust fund man-\nager, or Uncle Fred proposes that you sink some money into a security but\nthe chart shows that the price is on a downward trajectory, just say no. You\nmay be astonished at how many otherwise intelligent and sensible people\nyield to the supposed superior expertise of their money managers when even\na 12-year-old kid can see that the security is tanking. “It'll come back,” they\nsay. The only sane reply is, “Okay, let’s wait for it to prove it’s coming back.”\n\nRd Never take a tip without first consulting the chart. No excuses! You can get\nRS free charts at a dozen Web sites. You don’t need to become a full-fledged\nmarket technician to observe whether a price is rising or falling. And you\nshould never buy into a falling price. What if your broker or Uncle Fred was\nright, and the falling price abruptly turns up? Well, too bad. You have an\nopportunity loss. Missing a trade is okay. You had a good reason to miss the\ntrade — it didn’t qualify under your trading plan.\n\nIf you do succumb to the broker or Uncle Fred, acknowledge that taking the\ntrade is gambling and doesn’t belong in the same mental box as trades made\nunder your carefully thought-out risk-reward trading plan. Good trading is\nnot gambling. In good trading, you don’t have unknown outcomes and there-\nfore you have no such thing as “luck.”\n\nAvoid Euphoria and Despair\n\nYou should make the trading decision on the empirical evidence on the chart\nand not on some emotional impulse. It’s human nature to bet a larger sum\n\nof money when you’ve just had a win, perhaps on less evidence than you\nnormally require to take a trade in the first place. Likewise, you may become\ntimid after taking a loss and pass on trades that offer a fabulous profit oppor-\ntunity by your own technical standards.\n\nBER A good technical trader follows his trading plan and disregards the emotions\nPa created by the last trade. This basic rule is why technical traders use indica-\ntors as systematically as possible, even the ones who modestly shy away from\nclaiming to have a “trading system.” A good trading regime employs trading\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info\n\n299",

Trading is a business, and \nbusiness should be conducted in a nonemotional manner.\nFocus on Making Money, \nNot Being Right\nWhen you ask brokers and advisors for the single biggest character flaw of \ntheir customers, they all say the same thing, “The customer would rather be \nright than make money.” One case stands out: Refusing to take a loss. Either \nthe trader didn’t have a stop-loss rule in the first place (a situation you can \navoid by checking out Chapter 5), or he refused to obey it. To take a loss says \nto him that he’s wrong about the direction of the security, and he takes it as a \npersonal affront.\nSome people have an unusually hard time facing losses, and because they \ncan’t take a small loss, they end up taking big ones, which only reinforces the \nfear and loathing of loss. Soon you’re not trading systematically, but on emo-\ntion — and worse, the single emotion of fearing losses. If you start falling into \nthis morass, stop trading. Develop a different trading plan that is designed to \ntakes fewer losses.\nDon’t Let a Winning Trade \nTurn into a Losing Trade\nYou can have a fine trading system with excellent indicators properly back-\ntested for the securities you’re trading but still be a lousy trader if you don’t \nhave sensible trading rules. A good trader differentiates between indicators \n(which only indicate; see Chapter 4) and trading and money-management \nrules (which manage the risk; see Chapter 5).\nHow can a winning trade turn into a losing trade? Many ways, including\n \n✓ Failure to use a stop-loss.\n \n✓ Adjusting perception of risk while the trade is in progress by look-\ning at a new indicator that’s not backtested and not part of the trad-\ning plan. It’s okay to use a new indicator in mid-trade if you’re sure of \nwhat the new indicator really means, but not if it’s only a wild guess, or \nworse, the advice of some guru.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Your indicators tell you that the price is \nnot likely to go back to the old high but that’s the amount of money you \nwant to make. You’re trying to tell the market what to do, which never \nworks. This is how you start to see what you want to see on the chart \nrather than what’s there — in other words, wishful thinking.\nFollowing your trading plan takes guts. Quantify the amount of loss before \nplacing the trade and accept the losses that do occur (and they will!). Eat \nyour spinach — take the darn loss and move on. This principle is trader \ndiscipline, and if you don’t have it, you will not be a successful trader.\nSidestep the Temptation to Curve Fit\nJust because an indicator “fits” your chart of historical data doesn’t make \nit a workable indicator for the future. Curve-fitting refers to backtesting your \nindicators on historical data to see which parameters would have worked \nthe best (see Chapter 4). A good technical trader doesn’t curve fit but rather \nbacktests indicators by using realistic assumptions. If you overanalyze indi-\ncators so that they’re a perfect fit for the past, they almost certainly fail to \nwork in the future.\nAcknowledge that it’s okay to have numerically more losing trades than win-\nning trades as long as the gain-loss ratio is more than 1:1. In the same vein, if \nyou’re buying someone else’s trading system, be sure that it’s not just some \nbright idea that would’ve worked in the past but is so complex and detailed \nthat it won’t work on a broader range of conditions.\nKnow When to Hold ‘Em \nand When to Fold ‘Em\nPosition sizing is a thorny subject on which statistics experts disagree. Is \nthere a single best portion of your capital stake to bet on any one round of \ntrading? Yes, depending on which theory you accept. You may not want to \nget into the theoretical discussion of position sizing, but even so, you know \nthat in poker, if you have four aces, you bet more than if you have a pair of \nsevens.\nLikewise, in securities trading, you need to rely on your indicators to tell you \nwhether you have a good hand and can scale up the amount at risk, or have \na dud and may need to tighten stops or even fold.

Either method is “right,” but \nonly one method is right for you and your risk appetite.\nDiversify\nDiversification reduces risk. The proof of the concept in financial math won its \nproponents the Nobel prize, but the old adage has been around for centuries: \n“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” In technical trading, diversification \napplies in two places:\n \n✓ Your choice of indicators: You improve the probability of a buy/sell \nsignal being correct when you use a second, noncorrelated indicator \nto confirm it. You don’t get confirmation of a buy/sell signal when you \nconsult a second indicator that works on the same principle as the first \nindicator. Momentum (see Chapter 13) doesn’t confirm relative strength \nbecause it adds no new information. Widen your horizon beyond a few \nindicators, and seek different concept indicators instead of torturing \nold indicators to come up with better parameters.\n \n✓ Your choice of securities: You reduce risk when you trade two securi-\nties whose prices move independently from one another. If you trade a \ntechnology stock, you achieve no diversification at all by adding another \ntechnology stock. Instead, you may get a better balance of risk by adding \na stock from a different sector. If you trade metals futures, add some-\nthing from agriculture or finance to get diversification. You can estimate \ndegree of correlation scientifically with a spreadsheet or informally by \neye (charting both securities in the same space).\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

You use indicators for\nmany trading-related decisions, including identifying a trend, knowing when\nto stay out of a security that isn’t trending, and knowing where to place a\nstop-loss, to name just a few.

Think of the bar as a miniature indi-\ncator. For example, when you have a series of higher highs and suddenly the\nnext bar closes far down and at the low of the day, the crowd is sending you\na message with a foghorn — this move is over.\n\nEvery bar tells a story about crowd behavior. Exceptional bars tell you more\nthan ordinary bars, but try to listen to all bars. Floor traders complain that\nelectronic trading lacks something valuable that being on the exchange floor\noffers — the noise of the crowd.

    "text": "304\nPart VI: The Part of Tens \nUnderstand Your Indicator\nUse indicators that make sense to you in terms of crowd behavior. You need \nto use an indicator that you trust, and you can’t trust an indicator if you don’t \nunderstand how it reflects crowd behavior. Don’t use an indicator mechani-\ncally because some self-styled expert says that it has magical properties. The \nworld is full of great indicators. Get your own.\nIf math isn’t your strong suit, don’t let it hold you back from using math-\nbased indicators. You don’t need to know the math behind an indicator if you \nunderstand how it works. Think of technical analysis as a giant department \nstore full of indicators. One department or another has an indicator that can \nwork for you. If you can’t find it, keep looking.\nTrade What You See\nPatterns are indicators, too. Prices never move in a straight line, at least not \nfor long, and patterns can help you identify the next price move. When you \nsee a double bottom, you can feel confident that the right trade is to buy — \nand this principle is true well over half the time and normally returns a gain \nof 40 percent. Some patterns are easy to identify and exploit, while others \nmay elude you. If you can’t see it, don’t trade it. Patterns also aid you in \nseeing a big picture when you change your chart’s time frame (from daily to \nweekly, for example). Finally, you don’t have to believe in elaborate theories \nabout cycles or Fibonacci numbers to use a Fibonacci retracement pattern. \nMany experienced traders eschew math-based indicators and use only pat-\nterns, and for this reason alone, it pays to find out how to see patterns.\nUse Support and Resistance\nSupport and resistance (see Chapter 10) are valid concepts that all tech-\nnical traders respect. You can pinpoint support and resistance by using \nany number of techniques, including hand-drawn straight lines or bands \nand channels created out of statistical measures. Momentum and relative \nstrength indicators can help estimate support and resistance, too. To pre-\nserve capital, always know the support level of your security and get out of \nDodge when it’s broken.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "305\n Chapter 19: Ten Rules for Working with Indicators\nFollow the Breakout Principle\nThe breakout concept (which I cover in Chapters 10 through 12) is univer-\nsally recognized and respected. A breakout tells you that the crowd is feeling \na burst of energy. Whether you’re entering a new trade or exiting an existing \none, trading in the direction of the breakout usually pays. Studying the condi-\ntions under which real breakouts occur is also beneficial so that you don’t \nget zapped by false breakouts.\nWatch for Convergence and Divergence\nWhen your indicator diverges from the price, look out. Something’s happen-\ning. You may or may not be able to find out why, but divergence often spells \ntrouble. Convergence is usually, but not always, comforting. (This rule refers \nto convergence and divergence of indicators versus price, not the internal \ndynamics of indicators like the MACD.) For more on convergence and diver-\ngence, check out Chapter 4 and 12.\nIf your security is trending upward and the momentum indicator is pointing \ndownward, you have a discrepancy. The uptrend is at risk of pausing, retrac-\ning, or even reversing. If you’re risk averse, exit. Look for divergence between \nprice and volume, too. Logically, a rising price needs rising volume to be \nsustained. The most useful divergence is a paradoxical one, where the price \nis falling but by less than abnormally high volume would suggest. This diver-\ngence may mark the end of a major downtrend and is more reliable than the \npercentage retracement or round numbers touted by market “experts.”\nBacktest Your Indicators Properly\nYou’re free to use the standard indicator parameters in software packages \nand on Web sites. Experience shows that the standard parameters are useful \nover large amounts of data and large numbers of securities — that’s why \ntheir inventors chose them. For this reason, some traders never feel the need \nto perform their own backtests. They accept the standard parameters and \nput their effort into something else, like bar or pattern reading.\nBut if you are going to backtest indicators to refine the parameters, do it \nright. Use a large amount of price history when testing an indicator — and \ndon’t make the indicator fit history so perfectly that the minute you add \nfresh data, the indicator becomes worthless (a waste of time called curve-\nfitting). Observing price behavior and estimating the range of sensible and \nreasonable parameters is better than finding the perfect number. The perfect \nnumber for the future doesn’t exist.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "306\nPart VI: The Part of Tens \nAcknowledge That Your \nIndicator Will Fail\nIndicators are often wrong. Support lines break for only a day or two instead of \nsignaling a new trend as a breakout is supposed to. Textbook-perfect confirmed \ndouble bottoms fail the very next day instead of delivering that delicious 40 \npercent profit. And moving averages generate whipsaw losses even after you’ve \nadded every clever and refined filter known to man.\nIt’s a fact of life — your indicator will fail and you will take losses in technical \ntrading. Don’t take it personally. Indicators are only arithmetic, not magic. \nYou will take losses in winging-it trading, too. Console yourself with know-\ning that using indicators reduces losses over winging it, but indicators never \neliminate all losses.\nAccept That No Secret Indicators Exist\nTechnical traders have devised thousands of patterns and math-based indi-\ncators. They can be combined in an infinite variety of ways over an infinite \nnumber of time frames with an infinite number of qualifying conditions. So \nthe idea that somebody has discovered a superior combination of indicators \nis possible. But none of the indicators is a secret, and no indicator combo is \ngoing to be right all the time.\nThe secret of successful trading doesn’t lie in indicators. Shut your ears to \nthe guy trying to sell you an indicator that “never fails!” Of course it fails. If \nit never fails, why would he sell it to you? And why should you have to pay \nfor an indicator in the first place? You don’t. Every indicator ever invented is \neasily available in books, magazines, and on the Internet.\nPlay Favorites\nIndicators are addictive. You read about a new indicator that seems so logi-\ncal and appropriate that it becomes your new darling. Suddenly you can \napply it everywhere. It’s good to be adaptive and flexible, but remember \nthat the purpose of using indicators is to make money trading, not to get a \nnew vision of how the world works. Always check that your new indicator \nplays well with your old indicators. You picked your favorite indicators for a \ngood reason — they help you make good (profitable) trading decisions. Keep \ndiscovering new indicators, but don’t fall in love unless the new indicator \nmeshes well with the old ones.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Pioneers such as W. D.\nGann, Richard Wyckoff, Richard Schabacker, and Charles Dow, all from the\nearly 1900s, would have recognized just about everything I mention here.\n\nAnd yet ... the markets have changed in the last five to ten years. They\nchanged in ways that traders could pretty much foresee, but still struggle to\nunderstand and adapt to them. Much of the change arises from technological\nadvances and from the new prominence of math whizzes who are able to har-\nness technology in ways mere mortals like myself can barely grasp. But fear\nnot — these changes do not wipe out the opportunity for regular folks who\nare not math whizzes to trade profitably by using technical analysis. In this\nchapter, I not only point out what changes are occurring, but also give some\nadvice for navigating these advances in the market.\n\nTechnical Analysis Is Universally\nAccepted\n\nIn 1980, traders viewed technical analysis largely as an oddball or even crack-\npot backwater of investment theory. The explosion of interest in technical\nanalysis since then can be attributed to numerous forces, including\n\nThe failure of fundamental-based advisors and managers to deliver\nconsistent and high returns\n\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "308\nPart VI: The Part of Tens \n \n✓ The spread of personal computers to almost every home\n \n✓ The Internet\nSo pervasive has technical analysis become that today you can find it in \nsocial networks like YouTube and Twitter. Someone who mentioned MACD \nin 1980 may have been considered a nut job; today if you don’t know the \nterm, you’re hopelessly outdated. Note that change in the investor and trader \nmind-sets are arising from the retail masses and the software geeks and bro-\nkers who serve them, rather than from the academics or the conventional \ninvestment management firms. Technical analysis is the tool of a democratic \nrevolution against security market elites. Now the crackpots are the ones \ndenying the usefulness of technical analysis.\nAlgorithmic Trading Is on the Rise\nThe rise of algorithmic trading is the logical extension of the acceptance of \ntechnical analysis. Algorithmic trading is automated order-entry designed in \nadvance by traders employing computer programming but executed entirely \nby computers. Algo trading is also named robot trading (and the program is \nnamed a robot). Algo trading identifies high-probability trades by using indi-\ncator analysis, arbitrage opportunities, intermarket analysis, or some other \naspect of price behavior. Traders widely use algorithmic trading in equity \nand commodity markets, including foreign exchange, and it accounts for a \nhigh and rising percentage of total volume.\nA special variety of algo trading is high-frequency trading that seeks to \nexploit tiny and momentary price gaps identified directly from electronic \ninformation, usually price information but also volume and other inputs. \nBecause computer data processing is far faster than human brain data pro-\ncessing, trades can be executed in rapid-fire manner, with hundreds of trades \nexecuted in a minute or two.\nForeign Exchange Is More Prevalent\nThose individuals discouraged by the difficulty of beating the market or even \njust keeping even in equities are often seduced by the idea that trading for-\neign exchange (or FX) is somehow easier and, because of the use of leverage, \nmore profitable. Client standards are low because the broker has the right to \nclose any trade the instant it falls to breakeven, thereby preventing a loss the \ncustomer may not be able to cover. A trader is allowed to open an account \nwith a small charge (as small as $500) on a credit card and begin trading the \nsame day.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "309\n Chapter 20: Ten Ways the Market Has Changed\nA new breed of spot FX retail brokers promote the idea that FX trading is an \neasy way to get rich quick, even though it should be obvious that in all trad-\ning, the little guy is always up against big institutions with deeper pockets. \nHaving said that, the FX market is the biggest in the world at about $4 trillion \nper day and operates virtually 24 hours per day, reducing liquidity risk and \nthe ability of any single player to move the market. The FX market is also \nfairly immune from insider information, and best of all, it is highly trended \nand thus suitable for technical analysis.\nHard Assets Have Revived Interest\nTechnical analysis can be applied to any security, even when you know abso-\nlutely nothing about the fundamentals. Technical skills encourage traders to \nfeel qualified to foray into hard assets as well as equities.\nHard assets include precious metals such as gold and industrial metals such \nas nickel and copper, as well as oil and more perishable commodities like \ngrains, cocoa, and sugar. Interest in hard assets as an investment class \nwaxes and wanes throughout history, but until recently, trading them was \ntoo expensive for the average trader to attempt. Now brokers offer mini-\ncontracts, exchange-traded funds, and complex structured deals that allow \nanyone to participate in the hard-asset markets.\nIn addition, during the early 2000s, U.S. commodities exchanges modernized \nthe reporting of volume from next day to same day. Commodity traders still \ndon’t get live real-time volume, as on the equity exchanges, but at least they \nget it before the sun goes down. Volume can be a critical confirming or warning \nfactor.\nIntermarket Trading Is Blooming\nBecause you can apply technical analysis to any security, the resulting wide-\nspread embrace of trading multiple asset classes simultaneously has some \nodd side effects. Big price moves occur without any real connection to the \nfundamental supply-and-demand dynamics of one security and often without \nthe technical indicators giving the customary signals (such as overbought \nor oversold) because of a change in either the fundamentals or technicals in \nanother seemingly correlated security. Oil, for example, moves in an inverse \ncorrelation with the U.S. dollar, so you can’t look at only your oil price \nchart — you also have to look at the chart of euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. \nSometimes gold is inversely correlated with the dollar and sometimes with \nthe euro.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "310\nPart VI: The Part of Tens \nIntermarket trading capability has resulted in some bizarre and frightening \noutcomes, like the number of barrels of oil referred to in crude oil futures \ncontracts exceeding the number of barrels of oil in existence during the late \n2000s. The key concept behind intermarket integration is risk appetite and \nits mirror image, risk aversion. Traders become risk averse when indicators \nsuggest a security is overbought, but now traders become risk averse when \nsome other security’s indicators suggest it is overbought. This factor adds \nanother layer of needed work on top of the chart work you’re doing on your \nsecurity.\nLeverage Is Dangerous\nWhen your indicators fall in line one by one to increase your confidence \nin your trade, you may be tempted to increase your position by borrow-\ning money to supplement your starting capital. Leverage is the use of debt \nissued by brokers to traders. In the U.S. equity markets, the most a trader \ncan borrow from the broker is 50 percent of the face amount of the trade, \nwith each broker applying its own standards so that the amount of leverage \nextended to the trader is often a great deal less. In commodity trading and in \nsome foreign markets, the allowable leverage is a lot higher.\nIn foreign exchange, for example, leverage of 100 to 300 times used to be \ncommonplace but was reduced in 2010 to 50 times. Even this reduction in \nleverage means that the trader with a capital stake deposited at the broker \nof $10,000 can trade contracts collectively worth $500,000. It should go \nwithout saying that trading with such high leverage is seldom a good idea, if \nonly because you may be tempted to ditch your stops or otherwise engage \nin wishful thinking instead of heeding your trading rules. Technical analysis \ncan’t stand alone without trading rules.\nInternationalization Is Becoming \nMore Popular\nDue to technology, foreign brokers are able to offer the same services as \ndomestic brokers, often at vastly reduced costs, and escaping U.S. regula-\ntions. For example, in 2009, the National Futures Association instituted a new \nregulation disallowing a foreign exchange trader from creating a hedging \nposition in the same account (in other words, the first position was long a \ncurrency and the new position is short to offset — or hedge — the first one). \nThis regulation applies only to U.S. trading accounts and traders can circum-\nvent it by having an account outside the United States.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "311\n Chapter 20: Ten Ways the Market Has Changed\nSecond, internationalization is seen in the form of domestic investors in a \ncountry (such as Japan) that is actively seeking higher returns in foreign mar-\nkets and currencies, even when they’re using domestic brokers who now offer \nspecial securities with embedded options like limited foreign exchange risk.\nLast but not least, internationalization takes the form of corporations or sov-\nereigns issuing securities, usually bonds or specialized forms of bonds, in \nforeign countries in its own currency or the foreign country’s currency. Some \nof these securities are wildly complicated, such as a bond-like derivative con-\ntract that offers a fixed 8 percent return for five years on a foreign exchange \ncontract of the Brazilian real-Euro cross rate with a 2 percent floor on foreign \nexchange losses. Eek!\nInternationalization raises market participation and thus liquidity, but also \nintroduces new uncertainties to your comfort level in your technical analysis. \nNew regulations and the existence of these newfangled exotic contracts and \nblended securities make it very hard to backtest your indicators. Also, you \nmay think that you know where support and resistance lie on your chart, but \nyou will be wrong if some big institution has an options strike price under \nor over it. Plus, some event in a foreign country can move the price of your \nsecurity in a new, never-seen-before way.\nHedge Funds and Sovereign Wealth \nFunds Are the New Big Dogs\nHedge funds were invented in the late 1940s and sovereign wealth funds in \n1953 (Kuwait) but accelerated as a trend around 2000. Both types of funds \nembrace trading strategies that travel far beyond the buy-and-hold idea, \nincluding sophisticated technical analysis applications as well as the following:\n \n✓ Taking short positions to benefit from down markets\n \n✓ Diversifying holdings into asset classes previously dominated by a small \ngroup of specialists (such as oil, metals, and agricultural commodities)\n \n✓ Getting into emerging markets\nHedge funds and sovereign wealth funds are run by well-educated, advanced-\nmath managers who question conventional ways of thinking about markets, \nand in many cases engage in algorithmic trading, including high-frequency \ntrading. They are the big new players or “agents” in many markets. As techni-\ncal analysis-oriented players with deep pockets, they are market leaders and \nmay promote more trendedness and higher volatility, which means that you \nneed to stay on your toes and keep your indicators adaptive.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

    "text": "312\nPart VI: The Part of Tens \nPlatforms Are Emerging\nA platform is a computer capability upon which software applications can be \nbuilt. In trading applications, the platform provider offers two-way data trans-\nmission (prices and analysis to the user and trade orders from the user), usu-\nally with security, storage, and analytical options built in. Some platforms, \nsuch as Metatrader, allow open-source contributions from users that are \nthen available to everyone.\nAmong the first major trading platforms was TradeStation, which started as \na technical analysis software company and transformed itself into a broker \nthat offers live, online technical analysis woven into the order-entry pro-\ncess. Interactive Data is another broker that joined with data and technical \nanalysis vendor eSignal. Instead of doing your chart work on one PC and then \nswitching to the broker’s electronic order-entry Website, you perform all the \nfunctions in one space — and with the platform offering you ideas, analysis, \nand real-time alerts. Anyone can build an automated trading system using an \nadvanced platform — this is, of course, both a curse and an opportunity.\nExchange-Traded Funds \nHave Made Their Mark\nExchange-traded funds (ETF) is a class of investment fund that bundles \ntogether related securities and trades like an individual stock on an \nexchange. An ETF consists of a basket of securities that trades in its own \nright as a proxy for the collection. For example, the SPDR (“Spider”) \nexchange-traded fund serves as a proxy for the S&P 500 index.\nFrom a single ETF in 1993, the range of ETFs expanded to nearly a thousand \nETFs in the U.S. alone, with more being created by the month. Most ETFs rep-\nlicate the performance of a stock, bond, or commodity market — or take a \nposition that effectively shorts that market. ETFs are an alternative to mutual \nfunds, which create a pool of generally unrelated securities and almost never \noutperform the market indices. ETFs, while designed to trade at about the \nsame price as the net asset value of its components, are subject to supply and \ndemand of their own, and prices can vary widely from the collective prices of \nthe underlying securities. ETFs sometimes offer double or triple leverage and \ncan trade erratically, which reduces confidence in your technical analysis.\nwww.it-ebooks.info",

Many traders are satisfied with their broker's charting programs, which\nare becoming more advanced all the time. Using your broker’s charting soft-\nware saves time and reduces errors by combining analysis with order entry.\n\nI have been using Metastock by Equis (www. equis.com) since the early\n1980s and so to me it is the most user friendly. It comes with preset indica-\ntors, a user guide, and data to get you started.\n\nEqually valuable is the TC2000 software from Worden (www.worden .com).\nThe principle is to scan the equities universe on fundamental criteria, and\nthen apply key indicators. Worden offers first-class free seminars, too.\n\nOther charting software packages are\n\neSignal (www. eSignal .com)\n\n EnsignSoftware (www. ensignsoftware.com)\n NeoTicker (tickquest-inc. software. informer.com)\nNinjaTrader (www.ninjatraderpro.com)\n\nTradeStation (www.tradestation.com)\n\nWhat should you require of your software? At the least, your charting\nsoftware should have an easy interface with your source of raw data. You\nshould be able to switch time frames along a wide range (from three minutes\nto monthly). Your software should be able to show bars in regular OHLC\nformat, candlestick format, and point-and-figure. It should allow you to draw\nan unlimited number of lines at any slope and contain at least ten standard\nparameter indicators, including moving averages, MACD, stochastic oscilla-\ntor, Bollinger bands, and linear regression and linear regression channel. You\nalso want it to be capable of writing your own formulas and modifying the\nones included in the charting package.\n\nFutures magazine (www. futuresmag.com) and Technical Analysis of Stocks\nand Commodities magazine (www. traders .com) both offer annual reviews\nof all the charting software, all the system vendors, all the brokers, and so\non.
