### Complete Node Type Inventory (15 Nodes - 100% Documented)

**Core Workflow (3 nodes)**:
- ✅ Start - Workflow entry point
- ✅ End - Workflow exit point
- ✅ Agent - AI intelligence core

**Data & Tools (7 nodes)**:
- ✅ MCP - External APIs/market data (35+ tools for G'sves)
- ✅ File Search - Search through uploaded documents
- ✅ Code Interpreter - Execute Python code in workflows
- ✅ Custom Tool - Create tools from existing code
- ✅ Web Search Tool - Configurable web search with domain filtering
- ✅ Transform - Data transformation (formatting, conversions)
- ✅ Structured Output - Generate JSON objects

**Control Flow (3 nodes)**:
- ✅ If/Else - Conditional branching logic
- ✅ Loop (While) - Iterate until condition met
- ✅ Approval - Human-in-the-loop confirmations

**Utilities (2 nodes)**:
- ✅ Note - Workflow documentation and comments
- ✅ Set State - Manage conversation state variables

**Safety & Quality (1 node)**:
- ✅ Guardrails - Content filtering and boundary checking

### Implementation Phases - Updated

**Phase 1 - Basic (5 nodes)**: ~4-5 hours ← START HERE
- Start, End, Agent (2), If/Else
- Agent nodes call backend REST API functions
- Production-ready for basic market queries

**Phase 2 - Enhanced (11 nodes)**: +3-4 hours ← RECOMMENDED
- Add: Guardrails, Transform, Structured Output, Set State
- Adds safety, formatting, memory, clean APIs

**Phase 3 - Advanced (15 nodes)**: +2-3 hours ← OPTIONAL
- Add: Loop, Code Interpreter, Web Search, Approval
- Batch processing, custom logic, advanced features

**Total Time to Full Implementation**: 10-14 hours

### Honest Truth

**You CAN implement basic G'sves Agent Builder workflow TODAY** (Phase 1) with:
- Real-time stock quotes via MCP
- Market news
- Chart commands
- Professional responses
- Voice integration

**You MUST implement in Phase 2** (for complete migration):
- ✅ **Vector Store**: Migrate 213MB embedded knowledge base (trading education, patterns, risk management)
- ⚠️ **Loop Node**: OPTIONAL watchlist batch analysis (can keep frontend handling)

**Current System Note**: G'sves already uses `VectorRetriever` (Python) with 213MB of embedded trading knowledge. Vector Store migration replaces this with Agent Builder's no-code solution.

### Recommendation

**Start with the 7-node basic workflow (Part 1)**. It's production-ready and provides immediate value. Add advanced features (Part 3) in Phase 2 after basic workflow is stable.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE - October 9, 2025

**Your MCP servers are already running inside your backend as subprocesses!**

**You do NOT need to deploy market-mcp-server separately to Fly.io.**

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**For the simplest, most accurate implementation**, use:
- **SINGLE_SCREEN_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Updated October 9, 2025
  - 4-5 hours total
  - 5-node workflow
  - Uses existing backend REST API
  - No additional infrastructure deployment

**For detailed architecture explanation**, see:
- **AGENT_BUILDER_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md** - Complete integration guide
  - Explains MCP subprocess architecture
  - Backend API endpoint documentation
  - Function calling configuration examples

### What's Different in This Guide

**Note**: The sections below (Phase 1: MCP Server Preparation) contain outdated instructions for deploying a standalone MCP HTTP server. Your architecture already has MCP servers running as subprocesses within your backend container.

**For current best practices**, refer to the guides mentioned above.

**Continue reading below for comprehensive node documentation and advanced features (Phase 2 & 3).**

### Phase 1: MCP Server Preparation (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Deploy your market-mcp-server to the cloud so Agent Builder can access it.

**Who Does This**: Backend developer (technical)
**Result**: MCP server accessible at `https://market-mcp.fly.dev`

#### Step 1.1: Update MCP Server Transport

**Location**: `market-mcp-server/index.js`

**Current Code** (stdio - localhost only):
```javascript
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';

// ... server definition ...

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

**Replace With** (HTTP/SSE - cloud accessible):
```javascript
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';
import express from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    tools: 35  // Number of available tools
  });
});

// SSE endpoint for MCP protocol
app.get('/sse', async (req, res) => {
  console.log('New SSE connection');
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/message', res);
  await server.connect(transport);
});

// Message endpoint for client requests
app.post('/message', async (req, res) => {
  // SSE transport handles this automatically
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`MCP Server running on port ${PORT}`);
  console.log(`Health: http://localhost:${PORT}/health`);
  console.log(`SSE: http://localhost:${PORT}/sse`);
});
```

**Save File**: `market-mcp-server/index.js`

#### Step 1.2: Update Package Dependencies

**Location**: `market-mcp-server/package.json`

**Add Dependencies**:
```json
{
  "name": "market-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.0.0",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "yahoo-finance2": "^2.11.3",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5"
  }
}
```

**Install**:
```bash
cd market-mcp-server
npm install
```

#### Step 1.3: Test Locally

**Run Server**:
```bash
cd market-mcp-server
PORT=3000 node index.js
```

**Test Health Endpoint**:
```bash
# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T19:00:00.000Z",
  "tools": 35
}
```

**Test SSE Endpoint**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/sse
```

**Expected**: Connection stays open (SSE stream active)

✅ **If successful**: Move to deployment
❌ **If errors**: See [Troubleshooting - MCP Server](#troubleshooting-mcp-server)

#### Step 1.4: Deploy to Fly.io

**Initialize Fly App** (first time only):
```bash
cd market-mcp-server
fly launch --name market-mcp
```

**Answer Setup Questions**:
- Would you like to copy configuration? → **Yes**
- Choose region → **Select closest to you** (e.g., sea for Seattle)
- Would you like to set up PostgreSQL? → **No**
- Would you like to set up Redis? → **No**
- Would you like to deploy now? → **No** (configure first)

**Create `fly.toml`** (if not auto-generated):
```toml
app = "market-mcp"
primary_region = "sea"

[build]
  builder = "paketobuildpacks/builder:base"

[env]
  PORT = "8080"
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 8080
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0

[[services]]
  protocol = "tcp"
  internal_port = 8080

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 80
    handlers = ["http"]
    force_https = true

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 443
    handlers = ["http", "tls"]

  [services.concurrency]
    type = "connections"
    hard_limit = 25
    soft_limit = 20
```

**Deploy**:
```bash
fly deploy
```

**Expected Output**:
```
==> Building image
==> Deploying market-mcp
--> v1 deployed successfully
```

**Get URL**:
```bash
fly status
```

**Expected URL**: `https://market-mcp.fly.dev`

#### Step 1.5: Verify Deployment

**Test Health**:
```bash
curl https://market-mcp.fly.dev/health
```

**Expected**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T19:05:00.000Z",
  "tools": 35
}
```

**Test SSE**:
```bash
curl https://market-mcp.fly.dev/sse
```

**Expected**: Connection opens (SSE stream)

✅ **Phase 1 Complete!**
**Save This**: URL = `https://market-mcp.fly.dev`
**Time Checkpoint**: Should take ~1-2 hours

**Save**

#### Step 2.4: Wire All Connections

**CRITICAL**: Every node must be connected! Do this carefully.

**Make These Connections** (drag from output dot → input dot):

1. **Start → Node 1** (Classification Agent)
2. **Node 1 → Node 2** (Classification → Router)
3. **Node 2 "If" → Node 3** (Market Data path)
4. **Node 2 "Else" → Node 4** (Other queries path)
5. **Node 4 "If" → Node 5** (Chart command path)
6. **Node 4 "Else" → Node 6** (General chat path)
7. **Node 3 → Node 7** (Market data to formatter)
8. **Node 5 → Node 7** (Chart command to formatter)
9. **Node 6 → Node 7** (Chat response to formatter)
10. **Node 7 → End** (automatic)

**Visual Verification**:
```
Start
  ↓
[1] Classification
  ↓
[2] Route by Intent
  ├─ If (market_data) → [3] MCP ────────┐
  │                                      │
  └─ Else → [4] Chart or Chat           │
             ├─ If → [5] Chart Handler ──┤
             │                           │
             └─ Else → [6] Chat Handler ─┤
                                         ↓
                              [7] G'sves Response
                                         ↓
                                       End
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] No floating/unconnected nodes
- [ ] Both If/Else branches connected on each condition
- [ ] All paths lead to Node 7
- [ ] Node 7 leads to End

#### Step 2.5: Test in Preview Mode

**Click**: "Preview" button (top right)

**Test Case 1: Market Data Query**
```
Input: "What's Tesla's price?"

Expected Flow:
  Start → Classification → "market_data"
       → MCP Node (calls get_stock_quote)
       → G'sves Response → Output

Expected Output:
  "Tesla (TSLA) is currently trading at $XXX.XX, up/down X%"
```

**Test Case 2: Chart Command**
```
Input: "Show me Apple chart"

Expected Flow:
  Start → Classification → "chart_command"
       → Chart Handler
       → G'sves Response → Output

Expected Output:
  {"action": "display_chart", "symbol": "AAPL"}
```

**Test Case 3: General Chat**
```
Input: "Hello"

Expected Flow:
  Start → Classification → "general_chat"
       → Chat Handler
       → G'sves Response → Output

Expected Output:
  "Hello! I'm G'sves, your trading assistant..."
```

**Time Checkpoint**: Should take ~2-3 hours

---

### Phase 3: Backend Integration (1 hour)

**Goal**: Connect backend to use Agent Builder workflow instead of direct Responses API.

**Who Does This**: Backend developer
**Result**: Backend calls Agent Builder workflow for voice queries

#### Step 3.1: Update Backend Environment Variables

**Location**: `backend/.env` or Fly.io secrets

**Add**:
```bash
# Agent Builder Configuration
AGENT_BUILDER_WORKFLOW_ID=wf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # From Step 2.6
USE_AGENT_BUILDER=true

# Keep existing
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
# ... other vars
```

**If using Fly.io**:
```bash
fly secrets set AGENT_BUILDER_WORKFLOW_ID=wf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
fly secrets set USE_AGENT_BUILDER=true
```

#### Step 3.2: Update Agent Orchestrator

**Location**: `backend/services/agent_orchestrator.py`

**Find** (around line 4295):
```python
async def process_with_gvses_assistant(self, messages):
    response = await self.client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        assistant_id=self.gvses_assistant_id,
        messages=messages,
        tools=tools,
        store=True
    )
    return response
```

**Replace With**:
```python
async def process_with_gvses_assistant(self, messages):
    # Check if Agent Builder workflow should be used
    use_agent_builder = os.getenv('USE_AGENT_BUILDER', 'false').lower() == 'true'
    workflow_id = os.getenv('AGENT_BUILDER_WORKFLOW_ID')

    if use_agent_builder and workflow_id:
        # Use Agent Builder workflow
        return await self._call_agent_builder_workflow(messages, workflow_id)
    else:
        # Fallback to Responses API (current method)
        response = await self.client.responses.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            assistant_id=self.gvses_assistant_id,
            messages=messages,
            tools=tools,
            store=True
        )
        return response

async def _call_agent_builder_workflow(self, messages, workflow_id):
    """Call Agent Builder workflow via API"""
    import httpx

    # Extract latest user message
    user_message = messages[-1].get('content', '') if messages else ''

    # Call Agent Builder API
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f'https://api.openai.com/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute',
            headers={
                'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.api_key}',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            json={
                'input': {
                    'user_message': user_message
                }
            },
            timeout=30.0
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        result = response.json()

        # Transform to match expected response format
        return {
            'output': result.get('output', {}),
            'workflow_id': workflow_id,
            'execution_id': result.get('id')
        }
```

**Import** (add at top if not present):
```python
import os
import httpx
```

#### Step 3.3: Update Response Handling

**Location**: Same file, where responses are processed

**Find**:
```python
# Process response content
content = response.get('content', '')
```

**Update**:
```python
# Process response content (handle both Responses API and Agent Builder)
if 'output' in response:
    # Agent Builder workflow response
    content = response['output'].get('final_response', {})
    if isinstance(content, dict):
        # Extract text from formatted response
        content = content.get('text', str(content))
else:
    # Responses API response
    content = response.get('content', '')
```

#### Step 3.4: Test Backend Locally

**Start Backend**:
```bash
cd backend

## Part 3: ADVANCED FEATURES (Phase 2)

### Overview - What's Missing

The 7-node basic workflow is **production-ready** but lacks these advanced capabilities:

❌ **Vector Store Node**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for knowledge base
❌ **Loop Node**: Batch processing for watchlists and multi-stock analysis
❌ **Exec Node**: Command execution capabilities
❌ **Note Node**: Workflow documentation
❌ **User Type Node**: User classification and personalization

**Status**: Vector Store REQUIRED for migration, Loop Node optional, others identified but not documented

### Vector Store Node - REQUIRED FOR MIGRATION

**What It Does**: Replaces your existing Python VectorRetriever system with Agent Builder's no-code vector database.

**Current G'sves System** (What You're Migrating From):
- `backend/services/vector_retriever.py` - Python RAG implementation
- `backend/knowledge_base_embedded.json` - **213MB** of vector embeddings
- `backend/knowledge_base.json` - 3.2MB source trading knowledge
- Topics: risk_management, moving_averages, candlestick_patterns, technical_analysis
- Already in production using OpenAI embeddings

**Migration Goal**: Move this 213MB knowledge base from Python → Agent Builder Vector Store

**Why Migrate**:
| Python VectorRetriever (Current) | Agent Builder Vector Store (Target) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Requires code changes to update docs | Upload PDFs in UI |
| Developer-only maintenance | Anyone can update knowledge |
| 213MB JSON file on disk | Cloud-hosted vector database |
| Custom embedding code | Built-in vectorization |
| Harder to version/track changes | Visual versioning in Agent Builder |

#### Configuration (From Video Analysis)

**Adding to Canvas**:
1. Find "Vector Store" in node library (left sidebar)
2. Drag onto canvas
3. Place between classification and agent nodes

**Basic Settings**:
```yaml
Node Type: Vector Store
Name: Market Knowledge Base
Description: Historical market analysis and trading research
Index: [Auto-generated by Agent Builder]
Embeddings: [OpenAI text-embedding model - auto-configured]
```

**Uploading Documents** (Two Methods):

**Method 1: Drag and Drop** (Fastest)
1. Drag PDF/document files from your computer
2. Drop directly onto the Vector Store node
3. Files upload and begin vectorization automatically

**Method 2: Upload Button**
1. Click Vector Store node
2. Properties panel → "Upload Documents" button
3. Select files from file picker
4. Click "Upload"

**Supported File Types** (Confirmed from video):
- PDF documents (.pdf) ✅ PRIMARY use case
- Word documents (.doc, .docx) ✅ Confirmed
- Image files (formats unspecified) ✅ NEW - Confirmed in video
- Text files (.txt) ✅ Assumed supported
- Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) ⚠️ NOT mentioned in video (unconfirmed)

**Auto-Processing**:
- Agent Builder generates vector embeddings automatically
- Documents become searchable by connected agents
- Vectorization takes 15-30 minutes for large knowledge bases

**Connecting to Agents**:
```
Classification Agent
  ↓
MCP Node ← Can reference Vector Store
  ↓
Agent (with Vector Store access)
  ↑
  │
Vector Store (connected for retrieval)
```

**How It Works**:
```
1. User asks: "What's the historical performance of tech stocks during rate hikes?"
2. G'sves Agent receives question
3. Agent queries Vector Store: "tech stocks rate hikes historical"
4. Vector Store performs semantic search
5. Returns relevant research documents
6. Agent uses retrieved context in response
7. User gets research-backed answer
```

#### Example: Market Research Knowledge Base

**Vector Store Name**: `Market Research Database`

**Contents to Upload**:
- Historical market analysis reports (PDF)
- Trading strategy documents (Word)
- Technical analysis guides (PDF)
- Market commentary archives (PDF)
- Economic research papers (PDF)

**G'sves Agent Query Flow**:
```
User: "What's the best strategy for volatile markets?"
  ↓
G'sves Agent → Vector Store: "volatile market strategies"
  ↓
Vector Store Returns: [Relevant research documents]
  ↓
G'sves: "Based on historical analysis, volatile markets respond well to dollar-cost averaging and volatility hedging strategies. During the 2020 market volatility, portfolios using these approaches showed 15% better risk-adjusted returns."
```

#### Implementation Steps (Phase 2)

**Step 1: Prepare Documents**
```
market-knowledge/
├── research-reports/
│   ├── tech-sector-analysis-2025.pdf
│   ├── market-trends-q1.pdf
│   └── volatility-strategies.pdf
├── trading-patterns/
│   ├── head-shoulders-pattern.pdf
│   ├── moving-averages-guide.pdf
│   └── candlestick-patterns.pdf
└── company-profiles/
    ├── tesla-analysis.pdf
    ├── apple-fundamentals.pdf
    └── nvidia-growth-story.pdf
```

**Step 2: Add Vector Store Node**
1. Open Agent Builder workflow (edit mode)
2. Drag "Vector Store" from sidebar
3. Drop between Classification and MCP nodes
4. Name: "Market Knowledge Base"

**Step 3: Upload Documents**
1. Click Vector Store node
2. Properties panel → "Upload Documents"
3. Select all files from `market-knowledge/` folder
4. Wait for vectorization (5-10 minutes)
5. Verify: "35 documents uploaded, 1.2M tokens"

**Step 4: Connect to Agents**
1. Connect Vector Store output → G'sves Agent input
2. Update G'sves Agent instructions:

```
Before responding, you can query the Market Knowledge Base for relevant information.

If user asks about patterns, strategies, or analysis:
1. Query Vector Store with user's question
2. Use retrieved context in your response
3. Cite sources when available

Example:
User: "What's a head and shoulders pattern?"
→ Query Vector Store: "head and shoulders chart pattern"
→ Use retrieved documentation in response
→ Cite: "According to our technical analysis guide..."
```

**Step 5: Test**
```
Test Query: "What's a head and shoulders pattern?"

Expected Flow:
  Classification → "general_chat"
    → Chat Handler queries Vector Store
    → Retrieves pattern documentation
    → Response includes detailed explanation from PDFs

Expected Response:
  "A head and shoulders pattern is a bearish reversal signal. According to our technical analysis guide, it consists of three peaks: a higher middle peak (head) flanked by two lower peaks (shoulders). This pattern often signals the end of an uptrend. Historically, it has an 80% accuracy rate when the neckline is clearly broken."
```

**Status**: REQUIRED for full G'sves migration - implement in Phase 2

#### Vector Store Best Practices

**⚠️ Performance Optimization (CRITICAL)**:

Based on OpenAI Agent Builder best practices:

1. **Use Minimal Context** (Most Important)
   - Agent performance **degrades with excessive context**
   - Upload only curated, relevant documents
   - Remove redundant or outdated information regularly
   - More data ≠ better results

   **Why This Matters**:
   ```
   ❌ BAD: 100 PDFs with overlapping content = slow, confused responses
   ✅ GOOD: 20 curated PDFs with unique insights = fast, accurate responses
   ```

2. **Document Quality Over Quantity**
   - 10 high-quality, focused documents > 100 general documents
   - Remove duplicate information across files
   - Keep documents focused on specific topics

3. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Review uploaded documents quarterly
   - Archive outdated market analysis
   - Update with fresh research
   - Monitor agent response quality

4. **Configuration Best Practices**
   - Verify proper indexing (automatic in Agent Builder)
   - Monitor token counts during upload
   - Test retrieval quality after each major upload
   - Use descriptive names and descriptions for searchability

**Performance Indicators**:
- ✅ **Good**: Agent responses in 2-5 seconds with relevant context
- ⚠️ **Degrading**: Responses take 10+ seconds, context less relevant
- ❌ **Overloaded**: Responses slow, generic, or missing key information

**Action if Performance Degrades**:
1. Review uploaded documents - remove duplicates
2. Split large knowledge bases by topic (separate Vector Stores)
3. Test with smaller, focused document sets
4. Monitor token usage in Agent Builder dashboard

---

#### Knowledge Base Migration - Detailed Steps

**IMPORTANT**: Since you're moving everything to Agent Builder, you MUST migrate the existing 213MB knowledge base.

**Step 1: Locate Source Documents**

Your knowledge base was likely created from PDF/Word files. Find them:

```bash
# Check training/source directories
cd /Volumes/WD\ My\ Passport\ 264F\ Media/claude-voice-mcp/backend
find . -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.docx" | grep -i "training\|knowledge\|docs"

# Common locations:
ls -lh training/*.pdf
ls -lh docs/*.pdf
ls -lh knowledge_sources/*.pdf
```

**Expected Source Files** (based on knowledge_base.json topics):
- CBC Trading Group Technical Analysis.pdf
- Crypto Revolution Technical Analysis.pdf
- Risk Management Guide.pdf
- Candlestick Patterns Bible.pdf
- Moving Averages Guide.pdf
- Chart Encyclopedia.pdf
- Technical Analysis for Dummies.pdf

**If PDFs Not Found**: You'll need to recreate/source them. The embedded knowledge base cannot be directly uploaded (it's in embedding format, not readable documents).

**Step 2: Prepare Documents for Upload**

```bash
# Create migration folder
mkdir -p knowledge-migration/
cd knowledge-migration/

# Copy all source PDFs here
cp ../training/*.pdf ./
cp ../docs/*.pdf ./

# Verify file sizes
ls -lh
# Total should approximate 3-10MB (unembedded source docs)
```

**Step 3: Upload to Agent Builder Vector Store**

1. **Open Agent Builder** → Your G'sves workflow (edit mode)
2. **Add Vector Store Node**:
   - Drag "Vector Store" from left sidebar
   - Drop after Classification Agent
   - Name: "Trading Knowledge Base"
   - Description: "G'sves trading education, patterns, and risk management"

3. **Upload Documents**:
   - Click Vector Store node
   - Properties panel → "Upload Documents" button
   - Select ALL PDFs from knowledge-migration/ folder
   - Upload batch (Agent Builder handles multiple files)

4. **Wait for Vectorization**:
   - Progress bar shows embedding generation
   - **Time estimate**: 15-30 minutes for full knowledge base
   - **Result**: "X documents uploaded, Y million tokens embedded"

5. **Verify Upload**:
   - Check document count matches source PDFs
   - Review token count (should be similar to 213MB embedded = ~50M tokens)

**Step 4: Update Agent Configurations**

All agent nodes that need knowledge access:

**Chat Handler Agent** (Node 6):
```diff
Instructions:
You are G'sves, a friendly trading assistant.

Handle general conversation:
- Greetings: Be warm and welcoming
- Help requests: Explain what you can do
- Thanks: Acknowledge graciously

+ **Trading Knowledge Queries**:
+ When user asks about trading concepts, patterns, or strategies:
+ 1. Query the "Trading Knowledge Base" vector store
+ 2. Use retrieved context to provide detailed, educational responses
+ 3. Cite sources (e.g., "According to CBC Technical Analysis...")
+
+ Topics in knowledge base:
+ - Risk management and position sizing
+ - Candlestick patterns
+ - Moving averages and indicators
+ - Chart patterns (head & shoulders, triangles, etc.)
+ - Trading psychology and discipline
```

**G'sves Response Formatter** (Node 7):
```diff
You are the final response formatter for G'sves trading assistant.

You receive data from different sources:
- market_data: Real-time market information
- chart_command: Chart display instructions
- chat_response: General conversation
+ - knowledge_query: Retrieved trading education from vector store
```

**Step 5: Test Knowledge Retrieval**

**Test Case 1: Risk Management**
```
Query: "What's the recommended risk per trade?"
Expected: Uses vector store, mentions 1% risk rule from knowledge base
```

**Test Case 2: Technical Pattern**
```
Query: "Explain head and shoulders pattern"
Expected: Detailed pattern description from technical analysis docs
```

**Test Case 3: Strategy**
```
Query: "Best moving average settings for day trading?"
Expected: Retrieves MA strategies from trading guides
```

**Step 6: Deprecate Python Vector System**

After confirming Agent Builder Vector Store works correctly:

```bash
# Backend cleanup (DO THIS LAST - after thorough testing)
cd backend/services
git mv vector_retriever.py DEPRECATED_vector_retriever.py

# Archive embedded knowledge base
git mv ../knowledge_base_embedded.json ../ARCHIVED_knowledge_base_embedded.json
git mv ../knowledge_base.json ../ARCHIVED_knowledge_base.json

# Update agent_orchestrator.py
# Remove lines 24 and 89:
# - from services.vector_retriever import VectorRetriever
# - self.vector_retriever = VectorRetriever()

git commit -m "Migrate knowledge base from Python to Agent Builder Vector Store"
```

**Migration Checklist**:
- [ ] Located source PDFs (training/*.pdf)
- [ ] Created knowledge-migration/ folder
- [ ] Uploaded all PDFs to Agent Builder Vector Store
- [ ] Verified vectorization complete (X docs, Y tokens)
- [ ] Updated Chat Handler agent instructions
- [ ] Updated Response Formatter agent instructions
- [ ] Tested 3+ knowledge queries successfully
- [ ] Agent Builder responses match Python VectorRetriever quality
- [ ] Deprecated Python vector_retriever.py
- [ ] Archived knowledge_base_embedded.json
- [ ] Removed VectorRetriever from agent_orchestrator.py
- [ ] Committed changes to git

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT delete Python vector system until Agent Builder Vector Store is fully tested and working!

### Loop Node - OPTIONAL FOR BATCH OPERATIONS

**What It Does**: Enables iteration through arrays, batch processing, and multi-item operations.

**Use Cases for G'sves**:
1. **Watchlist Analysis**: Process 10-20 stocks at once
2. **Multi-Symbol Comparison**: Compare TSLA, AAPL, NVDA side-by-side
3. **Historical Data Collection**: Iterate through time periods
4. **News Aggregation**: Batch fetch 50 articles

#### Loop Types (Confirmed from Video)

**While Loop** (Confirmed in Tutorial):
```yaml
Node Type: Loop (While)
Condition: Variable to check
Exit When: Condition evaluates to True/False

Use Case: Iterate until condition met
Example: Process array items, repeat agent steps, conditional logic
```

**Video Demonstrations**:
1. **Array Iteration**: While loop through array until end reached
2. **Conditional Repetition**: Run AI agent step repeatedly until variable value achieved
3. **Progress Tracking**: Continue loop until conversation goal reached

**Configuration:**
- **Exit Condition**: Set to "True" to continue looping
- **Break Logic**: Set to "False" to exit loop
- **Variable Checking**: Can evaluate any variable or agent output

**Note**: ForEach and For loops may exist but were NOT demonstrated in the tutorial video. While loop is the confirmed, production-ready option.

#### Configuration Example: Watchlist Analysis

**Loop Node Setup**:
```yaml
Node Type: Loop
Name: Watchlist Processor
Loop Type: ForEach
Input Variable: {{stock_watchlist}}
Iterator: {{current_symbol}}
Output Variable: {{all_results}}
```

**Loop Body** (nodes inside loop):
```
1. MCP Node: get_stock_quote({{current_symbol}})
   → Output: {{current_price}}

2. MCP Node: get_stock_news({{current_symbol}})
   → Output: {{current_news}}

3. Agent: Analyze sentiment
   → Input: {{current_price}} + {{current_news}}
   → Output: {{symbol_analysis}}

4. Transform: Store in results array
   → Add {{symbol_analysis}} to {{all_results}}
```

**After Loop** (aggregation):
```
Transform Node: Sort by performance
  → Input: {{all_results}}
  → Output: {{sorted_results}}

G'sves Agent: Generate summary
  → Input: {{sorted_results}}
  → Output: "Here's your watchlist analysis: NVDA up 5.1% leading, TSLA up 2.3%, AAPL down 0.5%. Tech sector showing strength today."
```

#### Implementation Pattern

**Typical Loop Flow**:
```
User: "Analyze my watchlist: TSLA, AAPL, NVDA"
  ↓
Classification: "market_data"
  ↓
Condition: Multiple symbols detected
  ↓
Loop Node: ForEach symbol
  │
  ├─ Iteration 1: TSLA
  │   └─ MCP: get_stock_quote("TSLA")
  │   └─ Store: {symbol: "TSLA", price: 242.50, change: +2.3%}
  │
  ├─ Iteration 2: AAPL
  │   └─ MCP: get_stock_quote("AAPL")
  │   └─ Store: {symbol: "AAPL", price: 178.20, change: -0.5%}
  │
  └─ Iteration 3: NVDA
      └─ MCP: get_stock_quote("NVDA")
      └─ Store: {symbol: "NVDA", price: 495.75, change: +5.1%}
  ↓
Aggregate Results:
  all_results = [TSLA data, AAPL data, NVDA data]
  ↓
G'sves Agent: Format comparison
  ↓
Response: "Your watchlist is mixed today. NVDA is the top performer up 5.1%, followed by TSLA up 2.3%. AAPL is slightly down 0.5%. Overall tech sector sentiment is positive."
```

#### Best Practices

**Performance Optimization**:
- ✅ Limit loop iterations (max 20 stocks per request)
- ✅ Use pagination for large datasets
- ✅ Implement timeout conditions (30 seconds max)
- ✅ Monitor loop execution time

**Error Handling**:
- ✅ Add Condition node for error checking inside loop
- ✅ Implement graceful failure (skip invalid items, continue)
- ✅ Log errors for debugging
- ✅ Set fallback values

**Testing**:
- ✅ Test with small dataset first (3-5 items)
- ✅ Verify exit conditions work correctly
- ✅ Check output format after loop
- ✅ Monitor performance with larger datasets (10-20 items)

**Recommended Limits for G'sves**:
- Watchlist processing: **Max 20 symbols** per request
- Historical data: **Max 365 iterations** for daily data
- News aggregation: **Cap at 50-100 articles**
- Timeout: **30-second max** execution time

**Status**: Ready to implement in Phase 2 (after Vector Store and basic workflow are stable)

### Combining Vector Store + Loop Nodes

**Advanced Pattern**: Knowledge-Enhanced Batch Processing

```
User Query: "Analyze my watchlist with historical context"

1. Classification Agent
   → Intent: "watchlist_analysis"

2. Condition: Route to Loop
   → Multiple stocks + historical context needed

3. Loop Node: ForEach stock in watchlist
   │
   ├─ MCP Node: Get current stock data
   │   → {{current_data}}
   │
   ├─ Vector Store: Retrieve historical analysis
   │   → Query: "Historical analysis for {{symbol}}"
   │   → {{historical_context}}
   │
   ├─ Agent: Combine real-time + historical
   │   → Input: {{current_data}} + {{historical_context}}
   │   → Output: {{symbol_insight}}
   │
   └─ Store: Add to {{comprehensive_analysis}}

4. Aggregation Agent
   → Input: {{comprehensive_analysis}}
   → Process: Identify patterns, trends, correlations
   → Output: {{final_analysis}}

5. G'sves Response
   → Rich, context-aware watchlist report
```

**Example Output**:
```
"Here's your watchlist analysis with historical context:

Tesla (TSLA) is trading at $242.50, up 2.3%. Based on our historical data, this price action is consistent with pre-earnings momentum patterns we've seen in Q4 2024. The stock typically sees 5-10% volatility around earnings.

Apple (AAPL) is at $178.20, down 0.5%. This pullback aligns with sector rotation we documented last quarter, where investors shift from mega-cap to growth stocks.

NVIDIA (NVDA) is the standout at $495.75, up 5.1%. Our research shows NVDA historically outperforms during AI investment cycles, similar to the 2023 rally.

Overall assessment: Your portfolio is positioned well for tech sector strength, with good diversification across established (AAPL) and high-growth (NVDA) names."
```

**Status**: Full implementation ready in Phase 2

## Part 4: TROUBLESHOOTING

### Troubleshooting: MCP Server

#### Issue: Health Endpoint Returns 404

**Symptoms**:
- `curl https://market-mcp.fly.dev/health` returns 404
- Server appears offline

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check server logs
fly logs --app market-mcp

# Verify app is running
fly status --app market-mcp
```

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Restart Server**
```bash
fly apps restart market-mcp
```

**Solution 2: Redeploy**
```bash
cd market-mcp-server
fly deploy
```

**Solution 3: Check Fly.io Dashboard**
- Go to fly.io/dashboard
- Click "market-mcp" app
- Verify status shows "Running"
- Check resource usage (CPU, memory)

---

#### Issue: SSE Endpoint Not Working

**Symptoms**:
- Health check works but SSE fails
- Agent Builder can't discover tools

**Solution**:

**Verify SSE Transport in Code**:
```javascript
// market-mcp-server/index.js
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';

// Check endpoint is registered
app.get('/sse', async (req, res) => {
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/message', res);
  await server.connect(transport);
});
```

**Test SSE Locally**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/sse
# Should keep connection open
```

---

#### Issue: "35 Tools Not Discovered" in Agent Builder

**Symptoms**:
- MCP node shows 0 tools
- "Loading..." forever
- Connection times out

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Test MCP Server Locally**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/sse
# Should return SSE stream
```

**Solution 2: Verify Tools List**
```bash
cd market-mcp-server
node index.js
# Check console output for tools list
```

**Solution 3: Check CORS Headers**
```javascript
// Ensure CORS is enabled
app.use(cors());
```

**Solution 4: Verify HTTPS**
- Agent Builder requires HTTPS
- HTTP will NOT work
- URL must be `https://market-mcp.fly.dev` (not `http://`)

---

### Troubleshooting: Workflow

#### Issue: "Add Missing Elements/Nodes" Error

**Symptoms**:
- Can't publish workflow
- Error message about missing connections

**Solutions**:

**Check Node Connections**:
1. Open workflow in edit mode
2. Check left sidebar "Nodes" tab
3. Verify ALL nodes are connected
4. Both If/Else branches must connect
5. Every node needs input (except Start) and output (except End)

**Visual Checklist**:
```
✅ Start → Node 1
✅ Node 1 → Node 2
✅ Node 2 "If" → Node 3
✅ Node 2 "Else" → Node 4
✅ Node 4 "If" → Node 5
✅ Node 4 "Else" → Node 6
✅ Node 3 → Node 7
✅ Node 5 → Node 7
✅ Node 6 → Node 7
✅ Node 7 → End
```

**Fix**: Reconnect any missing connections by dragging from output dot → input dot

---

#### Issue: Preview Mode Shows No Output

**Symptoms**:
- Workflow executes but no response
- Blank output in preview

**Solutions**:

**Step 1: Check Tool Call Logs**
```
1. Click "View tool call logs" in preview
2. Check for errors in tool calls
3. Verify MCP server is responding
4. Look for failed API calls
```

**Step 2: Test Simple Query**
```
Type: "Hello"
Expected: Should route to Chat Handler and return greeting
If this fails, workflow has fundamental issues
```

**Step 3: Verify Output Variables**
```
Check each node has output variable set:
- Node 1: classification_result
- Node 3: market_data
- Node 5: chart_command
- Node 6: chat_response
- Node 7: final_response
```

---

#### Issue: Classification Not Routing Correctly

**Symptoms**:
- Asked for Tesla price, got chart command
- Wrong path taken in workflow

**Solutions**:

**Step 1: Check Classification Output**
```
1. Preview mode
2. Type: "What's Tesla price?"
3. Click Node 1 (Classification)
4. Verify output shows "market_data"
```

**Step 2: Check Router Condition**
```
Node 2 condition must be EXACTLY:
{{classification_result}} == "market_data"

❌ Wrong: {{intent}} == "market_data"
❌ Wrong: classification_result == "market_data"
✅ Correct: {{classification_result}} == "market_data"
```

**Step 3: Improve Classification Instructions**
```
Add more examples to Node 1 instructions:
- "What's TSLA trading at?" → market_data
- "Get me Apple stock price" → market_data
- "Display NVDA chart" → chart_command
```

---

### Troubleshooting: Backend Integration

#### Issue: Backend Not Calling Agent Builder Workflow

**Symptoms**:
- Voice queries use old system
- No workflow execution logs in Agent Builder

**Solutions**:

**Check Environment Variables**:
```bash
fly secrets list --app gvses-market-insights

# Should show:
# USE_AGENT_BUILDER=true
# AGENT_BUILDER_WORKFLOW_ID=wf_xxxxx...

# If missing:
fly secrets set USE_AGENT_BUILDER=true --app gvses-market-insights
```

**Verify Backend Code**:
```python
# In agent_orchestrator.py
use_agent_builder = os.getenv('USE_AGENT_BUILDER', 'false').lower() == 'true'
print(f"Using Agent Builder: {use_agent_builder}")
```

**Test Locally**:
```bash
# Set locally
export USE_AGENT_BUILDER=true
export AGENT_BUILDER_WORKFLOW_ID=wf_xxxxx...

# Restart backend
uvicorn mcp_server:app --reload
```

---

#### Issue: "Workflow Not Found" Error

**Symptoms**:
- 404 error when calling workflow API
- "Workflow does not exist" message

**Solutions**:

**Verify Workflow ID**:
```python
# In backend code
workflow_id = os.getenv('AGENT_BUILDER_WORKFLOW_ID')
print(f"Using workflow: {workflow_id}")

# Check in Agent Builder:
# 1. Open workflow
# 2. Check ID in URL: /workflows/wf_xxxxx...
# 3. Update backend if different
```

**Check Workflow Is Published**:
1. Go to Agent Builder
2. "Manage" sidebar
3. Find "G'sves Market Assistant"
4. Verify status shows "Published"
5. Copy exact Workflow ID
6. Update backend environment variable

---

#### Issue: Response Format Incorrect

**Symptoms**:
- Backend receives data but can't parse it
- TypeError or JSON parsing errors

**Solutions**:

**Check Response Transformation**:
```python
# backend/services/agent_orchestrator.py

# Add logging
if 'output' in response:
    print(f"Agent Builder response: {response.keys()}")
    content = response['output'].get('final_response', {})
else:
    print(f"Responses API response: {response.keys()}")
    content = response.get('content', '')

print(f"Extracted content: {content}")
```

**Update Parsing Logic**:
```python
if 'output' in response:
    # Agent Builder response
    content = response['output'].get('final_response', {})
    if isinstance(content, dict):
        # Extract text from formatted response
        content = content.get('text', str(content))
else:
    # Responses API response (fallback)
    content = response.get('content', '')
```

---

### Troubleshooting: Voice

#### Issue: Voice Not Activating

**Symptoms**:
- Microphone button doesn't work
- No audio input detected

**Solutions**:

**Check Microphone Permissions**:
```javascript
// Frontend: Browser console
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'microphone' })
  .then(result => console.log('Mic permission:', result.state));

// Should show: "granted"

// If "denied":
// 1. Browser settings → Site permissions → Microphone
// 2. Allow for your domain
// 3. Refresh page
```

**Test in Different Browser**:
- Chrome: Usually works best
- Firefox: May need extra permissions
- Safari: Check privacy settings

**Check ElevenLabs Connection**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/elevenlabs/signed-url
# Should return signed WebSocket URL
```

---

#### Issue: Voice Hears But Doesn't Respond

**Symptoms**:
- Voice input recognized
- No voice output
- Backend receives query but no response

**Solutions**:

**Check ElevenLabs Signed URL**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/elevenlabs/signed-url

# Should return:
# {"signed_url": "wss://..."}
```

**Verify ElevenLabs Agent ID**:
```bash
echo $ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID
# Should show valid agent ID
```

**Test ElevenLabs Directly**:
1. Go to ElevenLabs dashboard
2. Click your agent
3. Test in ElevenLabs interface
4. If works there, issue is backend integration

**Check Agent Builder Workflow**:
```
1. Open Agent Builder
2. Click "Logs" sidebar
3. Find recent workflow execution
4. Check for errors in execution
```

---

### Emergency Rollback Plan

**If Everything Breaks:**

**Step 1: Switch Back to Old System**
```bash
# In backend .env, comment out:
# AGENT_BUILDER_WORKFLOW_ID=...
# Or set to false:
USE_AGENT_BUILDER=false

# Restart backend
fly apps restart gvses-market-insights
```

**Step 2: Disable ElevenLabs Webhook**
1. Go to ElevenLabs dashboard
2. Remove Agent Builder webhook
3. System reverts to old voice handling

**Step 3: Keep MCP Server Running**
- Don't shut down Fly.io deployment
- You can reconnect when issues are fixed
- Historical data still accessible

**Step 4: Debug Offline**
- Use Agent Builder Preview mode
- Test workflow without affecting live users
- Fix issues incrementally
- Re-enable when ready
