## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`agent_orchestrator.py`)

1. **Educational Intent Classification**
```python
educational_triggers = [
    "what does", "what is", "how do i", "how to", "explain",
    "buy low", "sell high", "support and resistance", 
    "start trading", "beginner", "learn"
]
```

2. **Educational Content Database**
- 10+ trading concepts with clear explanations
- Topics include: buy low/sell high, support/resistance, order types, market concepts
- Beginner-friendly language without jargon

3. **Enhanced Symbol Extraction**

- Expanded stopwords list (50+ common words)
- Prevents false positives from natural language

4. **Chart Command Integration**
- Educational queries can trigger visual elements
- "Show me X chart" properly loads charts
- Support/resistance queries add drawing commands
