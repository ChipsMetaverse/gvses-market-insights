# Headless Chart Service Architecture

## Phase 4 Implementation Complete ✅

### System Overview

The Headless Chart Service provides server-side chart rendering, screenshot capture, and vision model analysis capabilities. It integrates with the backend agent orchestrator to enable autonomous chart analysis without requiring user interaction. The system now includes full CI/CD automation, distributed worker coordination, pattern streaming capabilities, and intelligent pattern lifecycle management with rule-based evaluation.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Headless Chart Service (`backend/headless_chart_service/`)

**Purpose**: Render charts in a headless Chromium browser and capture screenshots for vision analysis.

**Key Features**:
- TypeScript implementation with Playwright for browser automation
- Command validation and normalization system
- Browser resource management with automatic cleanup
- Concurrent job handling with context limits
- Supabase-backed job persistence with restart recovery
- Retry logic for resilient rendering

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /health` - Service health check with browser status
- `POST /render` - Create chart render job
- `GET /jobs/:id` - Check job status and results
- **Dependency injection ready**: `JobPriorityQueue` accepts injected Supabase and WebSocket clients, enabling headless tests to run with in-memory mocks while production keeps defaults.

**Validation Features**:
- Command prefix validation
- Parameter type checking
- Duplicate command detection
- Command ordering for optimal execution
- Execution plan generation with timing

**Supported Commands**:
```
LOAD:<SYMBOL>              # Load symbol data
TIMEFRAME:<PERIOD>         # Set chart timeframe
INDICATOR:<TYPE>           # Add technical indicator
DRAW:LEVEL:<ID>:<TYPE>:<PRICE>  # Pattern support/resistance
DRAW:TARGET:<ID>:<PRICE>   # Pattern price target
DRAW:TRENDLINE:<ID>:<PARAMS>  # Pattern trendline
ANNOTATE:PATTERN:<ID>:<STATUS>  # Pattern status update
CLEAR:PATTERN:<ID>         # Clear specific pattern
CLEAR:ALL                  # Clear all overlays
SUPPORT:<PRICE>            # Mark support level
RESISTANCE:<PRICE>         # Mark resistance level
ENTRY:<PRICE>              # Entry point
TARGET:<PRICE>             # Target price
STOPLOSS:<PRICE>           # Stop loss level
FIBONACCI:<HIGH>:<LOW>     # Fibonacci retracement
```

### 3. Enhanced Chart Control (`frontend/src/services/enhancedChartControl.ts`)

**Purpose**: Process and render backend chart commands on the frontend.

**Features**:
- Lifecycle command parsing (Phase 3 patches applied)
- Pattern overlay rendering
- Drawing command execution
- Indicator management
- Real-time synchronization

### 4. Pattern Lifecycle Manager (`backend/services/pattern_lifecycle.py`)

**Purpose**: Track pattern states and generate lifecycle-aware commands.

**Pattern States**:
```
pending → confirmed → target_hit / invalidated
```

**Generated Commands**:
- `DRAW:LEVEL` - Pattern support/resistance levels
- `DRAW:TARGET` - Pattern price targets
- `ANNOTATE:PATTERN` - Pattern status overlays
- `CLEAR:PATTERN` - Pattern cleanup

## Data Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Agent Orchestrator]
    B --> C[Generate Commands]
    C --> D[Headless Service]
    D --> E[Render Chart]
    E --> F[Capture Screenshot]
    F --> G[Vision Analysis]
    G --> H[Pattern Detection]
    H --> I[Store Snapshot]
    I --> J[Frontend Sync]
    J --> K[Display Patterns]
```

### Detailed Flow:

1. **User Interaction**: User sends query via chat interface
2. **Agent Processing**: Backend agent analyzes query and generates chart commands
3. **Command Validation**: Headless service validates and normalizes commands
4. **Browser Rendering**: Playwright renders chart with commands in headless Chromium
5. **Screenshot Capture**: High-quality viewport screenshot captured
6. **Vision Analysis**: OpenAI Responses API analyzes chart image
7. **Pattern Detection**: Technical patterns identified with confidence scores
8. **Snapshot Storage**: Results stored with metadata in backend
9. **Frontend Sync**: Dashboard retrieves snapshot and renders patterns
10. **User Validation**: Accept/Reject controls for pattern confirmation

## Resource Management

### Browser Lifecycle
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single browser instance shared across jobs
- **Context Limits**: Maximum 5 concurrent contexts
- **Idle Timeout**: Browser closes after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old contexts closed when limit reached

### Job Management
- **Job Retention**: Jobs stored for 10 minutes
- **Status Tracking**: pending → in_progress → succeeded/failed
- **Background Processing**: Async job execution
- **Error Recovery**: Retry logic for transient failures

### Memory Optimization
- **Screenshot Buffering**: Direct base64 encoding without file I/O
- **Context Isolation**: Each job uses separate browser context
- **Resource Cleanup**: Explicit page and context closure

## Error Handling

### Retry Mechanisms
- **Navigation**: 3 attempts with 1-second delays
- **Screenshot**: 3 attempts with 500ms delays
- **Command Execution**: Graceful failure with warnings

### Validation Errors
- **Invalid Commands**: HTTP 400 with detailed error messages
- **Missing Parameters**: Validation feedback with suggestions
- **Duplicate Commands**: Automatic deduplication with warnings

### Resource Errors
- **Browser Crash**: Automatic restart on next request
- **Context Overflow**: Automatic cleanup of old contexts
- **Memory Pressure**: Idle timeout releases resources

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing Metrics
- **Health Check**: < 100ms
- **Command Validation**: < 10ms
- **Chart Render**: 2-5 seconds
- **Screenshot Capture**: < 500ms
- **Total Job Time**: 3-7 seconds typical

### Concurrency
- **Max Contexts**: 5 simultaneous renders
- **Job Queue**: Unlimited pending jobs
- **Throughput**: ~10 renders/minute sustained

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~200MB per context
- **CPU**: Moderate during rendering
- **Disk**: Minimal (no file I/O)

## Configuration

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=service-role-key
SUPABASE_SCHEMA=headless  # optional, defaults to "headless"

# Webhook Configuration
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=true      # Enable webhook notifications
```

#### Future Multi-Worker Configuration (Phase 2)
```bash
# Worker Identity (for multi-worker deployments)
WORKER_ID=worker-001      # Unique worker identifier
WORKER_MAX_JOBS=3         # Max concurrent jobs per worker
WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30000  # Heartbeat interval (30s)

# Job Leasing (distributed coordination)
JOB_LEASE_TIMEOUT=300000  # Job lease timeout (5 minutes)
JOB_LEASE_RENEWAL=240000  # Lease renewal interval (4 minutes)

# Worker Registration
WORKER_TAGS=["chrome","vision"]  # Worker capability tags
WORKER_REGION=us-east-1   # Worker deployment region
```

## Phase 2: Multi-Worker Architecture Design

### Worker Registration and Heartbeat System

**Worker Lifecycle**:
1. **Registration**: Workers register with unique ID, capabilities, and region
2. **Heartbeat**: Workers send periodic heartbeats (30-second intervals)
3. **Health Monitoring**: System tracks worker health and availability
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers deregister and release leases before shutdown

**Supabase Schema Extensions**:
```sql
-- Worker registration table
CREATE TABLE headless_workers (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,           -- WORKER_ID
  status VARCHAR NOT NULL,          -- 'active', 'draining', 'offline'
  max_jobs INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- WORKER_MAX_JOBS
  current_jobs INTEGER DEFAULT 0,   -- Current job count
  tags JSONB DEFAULT '[]',          -- Worker capabilities
  region VARCHAR,                   -- Deployment region
  last_heartbeat TIMESTAMPTZ,       -- Last heartbeat time
  registered_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Job leases for distributed coordination
CREATE TABLE headless_job_leases (
  job_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES headless_jobs(id),
  worker_id VARCHAR REFERENCES headless_workers(id),
  leased_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  renewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Distributed Job Processing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W1 as Worker 1
    participant W2 as Worker 2
    participant DB as Supabase DB
    participant WS as WebSocket Clients
    
    W1->>DB: Register worker (heartbeat)
    W2->>DB: Register worker (heartbeat)
    
    Note over DB: Job arrives in queue
    
    W1->>DB: Attempt lease acquisition
    DB-->>W1: Lease granted (job_id, expires_at)
    W1->>WS: Broadcast job_started
    
    W2->>DB: Attempt lease acquisition
    DB-->>W2: No available jobs
    
    W1->>DB: Renew lease (every 4 minutes)
    W1->>W1: Process job
    W1->>DB: Release lease + update status
    W1->>WS: Broadcast job_completed
    
    Note over W1,W2: Worker 1 crashes
    
    DB->>DB: Detect expired lease (after 5 minutes)
    DB->>DB: Mark job as orphaned
    W2->>DB: Attempt lease acquisition
    DB-->>W2: Lease granted (orphaned job)
    W2->>WS: Broadcast job_restarted
```

### Job Lease Management

**Lease Acquisition Logic**:
```typescript
class DistributedJobQueue {
  async acquireLease(workerId: string): Promise<RenderJob | null> {
    // Start database transaction
    const { data: job, error } = await supabase.rpc('acquire_job_lease', {
      p_worker_id: workerId,
      p_lease_timeout_ms: JOB_LEASE_TIMEOUT,
      p_worker_max_jobs: this.maxJobsPerWorker
    });
    
    if (error || !job) return null;
    
    // Schedule lease renewal
    this.scheduleLease Renewal(job.id, workerId);
    
    return job;
  }
  
  async renewLease(jobId: string, workerId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('headless_job_leases')
      .update({
        renewed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + JOB_LEASE_TIMEOUT).toISOString()
      })
      .eq('job_id', jobId)
      .eq('worker_id', workerId);
      
    return !error;
  }
}
```

**Orphan Job Recovery**:
```sql
-- Database function to detect and requeue orphaned jobs
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recover_orphaned_jobs()
RETURNS TABLE(job_id VARCHAR, worker_id VARCHAR) AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Find jobs with expired leases
  RETURN QUERY
  UPDATE headless_jobs hj
  SET status = 'queued',
      started_at = NULL,
      updated_at = NOW()
  FROM headless_job_leases hjl
  WHERE hj.id = hjl.job_id
    AND hj.status = 'in_progress'
    AND hjl.expires_at < NOW()
  RETURNING hj.id, hjl.worker_id;
  
  -- Remove expired leases
  DELETE FROM headless_job_leases
  WHERE expires_at < NOW();
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Load Balancing and Worker Selection

**Job Assignment Strategy**:
1. **Capacity-Based**: Assign to workers with available job slots
2. **Tag Matching**: Match job requirements with worker capabilities
3. **Region Affinity**: Prefer workers in same region for latency
4. **Round-Robin**: Distribute load evenly across available workers

**Worker Selection Algorithm**:
```typescript
interface WorkerCapacity {
  workerId: string;
  currentJobs: number;
  maxJobs: number;
  tags: string[];
  region: string;
  lastHeartbeat: Date;
}

function selectWorker(
  availableWorkers: WorkerCapacity[], 
  jobRequirements: { tags?: string[], region?: string }
): string | null {
  // Filter by availability and health
  const healthyWorkers = availableWorkers.filter(w => 
    w.currentJobs < w.maxJobs && 
    Date.now() - w.lastHeartbeat.getTime() < 60000 // 1 minute heartbeat tolerance
  );
  
  // Filter by job requirements
  const compatibleWorkers = healthyWorkers.filter(w => {
    if (jobRequirements.tags) {
      return jobRequirements.tags.every(tag => w.tags.includes(tag));
    }
    return true;
  });
  
  // Prefer same region
  if (jobRequirements.region) {
    const regionalWorkers = compatibleWorkers.filter(w => w.region === jobRequirements.region);
    if (regionalWorkers.length > 0) {
      return selectLeastBusy(regionalWorkers).workerId;
    }
  }
  
  // Fallback to least busy worker
  return compatibleWorkers.length > 0 
    ? selectLeastBusy(compatibleWorkers).workerId 
    : null;
}
```

### Webhook Lifecycle Notifications

**Enhanced Webhook Events** (Phase 2):
- `worker.registered` - Worker joins the cluster
- `worker.heartbeat_missed` - Worker health degradation
- `worker.offline` - Worker goes offline
- `job.lease_acquired` - Job assigned to worker
- `job.lease_renewed` - Job lease extended
- `job.lease_expired` - Job lease timeout (orphaned)
- `job.reassigned` - Job moved to different worker

**Worker Health Monitoring**:
```typescript
class WorkerHealthMonitor {
  async checkWorkerHealth(): Promise<void> {
    const staleThreshold = Date.now() - 90000; // 90 seconds
    
    const { data: staleWorkers } = await supabase
      .from('headless_workers')
      .select('*')
      .eq('status', 'active')
      .lt('last_heartbeat', new Date(staleThreshold).toISOString());
    
    for (const worker of staleWorkers || []) {
      // Mark worker as offline
      await this.markWorkerOffline(worker.id);
      
      // Trigger webhook notification
      await webhookService.triggerWorkerEvent(worker, 'worker.offline');
      
      // Recover orphaned jobs
      await this.recoverWorkerJobs(worker.id);
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 3 Implementation Details

#### Enhanced Distributed Stats (`DistributedQueue.getDistributedStats()`)

The `DistributedQueue` class now provides comprehensive observability data:

```typescript
getDistributedStats(): {
  localQueue: any;
  worker: ReturnType<typeof workerService.getStats>;
  activeLeases: number;
  enhanced?: {
    workers: Array<{
      worker_id: string;
      status: 'active' | 'draining' | 'offline';
      last_heartbeat: string;
      jobs_completed: number;
      jobs_failed: number;
      lease_count: number;
      avg_job_time_ms: number;
      cpu_usage: number;      // Percentage (0-100)
      memory_usage: number;    // Percentage (0-100)
    }>;
    queue_stats: {
      depth: number;
      processing: number;
      average_wait_time_ms: number;
    };
    lease_stats: {
      active: number;
      expired: number;
      average_age_seconds: number;
    };
  };
}
```

#### Pattern Verdict API Enhancement

The pattern verdict endpoint now includes full context:

```typescript
// POST /api/agent/pattern-verdict
{
  "verdict": "bullish" | "bearish" | "neutral",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "notes": "string",
  "pattern_id": "string",
  "symbol": "string",        // Added in Phase 3
  "timeframe": "string",      // Added in Phase 3
  "operator_id": "string"     // Added in Phase 3
}
```

#### Webhook Alert Service Extensions

New webhook alert methods in `webhookService.ts`:

```typescript
class WebhookService {
  // Worker health alerts
  async triggerWorkerOfflineAlert(workerId: string): Promise<void>
  async triggerWorkerOverloadedAlert(workerId: string, load: number): Promise<void>
  async triggerQueueBacklogAlert(queueDepth: number): Promise<void>
  async triggerOrphanJobsAlert(orphanedJobs: string[]): Promise<void>
}
```

### Multi-Worker Deployment Configuration

### ESM Runtime Setup

The headless service is built using TypeScript and relies on the ESM runtime for module loading. The service expects the following dependencies to be installed:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Supabase Schema Migration

To apply the Supabase schema migration, run the following command once:

```bash
npx supabase db push --file migrations/phase1_supabase.sql
```

### Smoke Test Persistence

To verify persistence is working correctly, run the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3100/render \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "timeframe": "1D",
    "priority": 50,
    "commands": ["LOAD:AAPL", "TIMEFRAME:1D"]
  }'

curl http://localhost:3100/metrics | jq '.queue'
curl http://localhost:8000/api/agent/chart-snapshot/AAPL?timeframe=1D
```
