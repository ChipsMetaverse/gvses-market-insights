# Voice Assistant Fix - October 5, 2025

## Problem Summary
Voice assistant was returning "I couldn't generate a response" for all price queries.

## Root Cause
**Critical Bug in `agent_orchestrator.py` line 3392**:
Tools were NOT being passed to the LLM for "price-only" queries.

## The Fix
Changed line 3392 from:
```python
if intent not in ["price-only", "educational"]:
```

To:
```python
if intent != "educational":
```

This ensures tools (like `get_stock_price`) are included for ALL intents except educational.

## Testing
Before: "I couldn't generate a response"
After: "The current price of Nvidia (NVDA) is $187.63..."

## Status
âœ… FIXED - Voice assistant now works correctly for all price, news, and technical queries.
