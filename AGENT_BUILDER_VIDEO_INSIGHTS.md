## üéØ What This Video Is About

**Agent Builder** is OpenAI's new **visual workflow tool** for creating AI agents without coding. The video demonstrates building a **Travel Agent** that:
1. Classifies user intent (itinerary vs flight info)
2. Routes to specialized agents
3. Uses web search for up-to-date information
4. Displays rich interactive widgets

## üîç Key Findings

### ‚ùå This Video Does NOT Cover:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration**
- Connecting external tools or APIs
- Authentication or security setup
- Deploying custom data sources

### ‚úÖ This Video DOES Cover:
- **Visual workflow building** (drag-and-drop nodes)
- **Agent nodes** for AI reasoning
- **Classifier nodes** for intent detection
- **If/Else logic nodes** for routing
- **Web search capabilities** (built-in)
- **Widget studio** for rich UI components
- **Publishing workflows** for production use

---

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow Architecture Demonstrated

```
Start Node
  ‚Üì
Classifier Node (itinerary vs flight)
  ‚Üì
If/Else Logic Node
  ‚îú‚îÄ Flight Info ‚Üí Flight Agent ‚Üí Widget (rich display)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Itinerary ‚Üí Itinerary Agent ‚Üí Text response
```

### Node Types Shown:

1. **Start Node**
   - Defines workflow inputs (e.g., `input_text: string`)
   - Entry point for user queries

2. **Classifier Node**
   - Uses AI to categorize user intent
   - Outputs JSON: `{"classification": "flight info" | "itinerary"}`
   - No custom code required

3. **If/Else Logic Node**
   - Branches workflow based on classifier output
   - Routes to specialized agents

4. **Agent Nodes** (Flight Agent, Itinerary Agent)
   - Each has **web search access** for real-time data
   - Configured with specific instructions
   - Example: "Build a concise one-day itinerary"

5. **Widget Studio**
   - Pre-designed UI components (flight cards, etc.)
   - Customizable (background color, timezone display)
   - Integrated via drag-and-drop

## üìù Example Use Cases from Video

### Test Query 1: Itinerary
**Input**: "What can I do in Tokyo?"
**Classifier Output**: `{"classification": "itinerary"}`
**Workflow Path**: Start ‚Üí Classifier ‚Üí If/Else ‚Üí Itinerary Agent
**Result**: Detailed one-day itinerary for Tokyo

### Test Query 2: Flight Information
**Input**: "Flights from SFO to Tokyo on October 7th"
**Classifier Output**: `{"classification": "flight info"}`
**Workflow Path**: Start ‚Üí Classifier ‚Üí If/Else ‚Üí Flight Agent ‚Üí Widget
**Result**: Interactive flight card with yellow background (destination-themed)

## üîß Technical Details Mentioned

### Web Search Integration
- Agents have **built-in web search** capability
- No API keys or configuration shown (appears automatic)
- Ensures up-to-date information (flights, events, etc.)

### Publishing Workflow
1. Click "Publish" button
2. Name the workflow (e.g., "Travel Agent")
3. Receive **Workflow ID** and **version number**
4. Get **ChatKit integration prompt** with credentials

### Example ChatKit Integration (shown at end):
```python
# Python script snippet
workflow_id = "wf_68e474d14d28819085"  # Example ID from video
version = "v1.0"
```

## üí° What This Means for Your Project

### For G'sves Agent Integration:

**What Agent Builder CAN Do** (based on video):
- Visual workflow design (no code)
- Intent classification (market vs chart commands)
- Routing logic (fast path vs deep analysis)
- Web search for news/catalysts
- Rich UI widgets for displaying charts/data

**What Agent Builder CANNOT Do** (not shown in video):
- Connect to your **market-mcp-server** directly
- Access **Alpaca API** or custom data sources
- Call FastAPI backend endpoints
- Use **external authentication** (API keys, etc.)

---

## üöß Missing Information (Not in Video)

The video **does not explain**:
1. **How to connect external APIs or MCP servers**
2. Authentication setup for custom tools
3. Deploying workflows to production
4. Using **MCP node** (only mentioned in Node Reference docs)
5. Network transport requirements for external integrations

---

## üîó What We Need to Find Next

To connect your **market-mcp-server** to Agent Builder, we need documentation on:

1. **MCP Node** setup (mentioned in Node Reference, not in video)
2. **mcp-remote** configuration (from TwelveLabs example)
3. **HTTP/SSE transport** for MCP servers (current setup uses stdio)
4. **Authentication** for external MCP servers
5. **Public hosting** requirements (Fly.io, ngrok, etc.)

## üìö Relevant Video Quotes

> "Agent Builder is designed to be an all-in-one space for designing, testing, and launching AI agents **visually and efficiently**."

> "The workflow setup interface features a **dotted grid where nodes can be placed**."

> "Each agent has **access to web search capabilities** to ensure up-to-date information."

> "For a **richer experience** in displaying flight information, Christina introduces a **widget studio** where a pre-designed widget is downloaded and integrated."

> "Once the agent is built and tested, Christina **publishes it**, naming it 'Travel Agent'."

## üéØ Conclusion

**This video is a high-level introduction to Agent Builder's visual workflow features, NOT a technical guide for MCP integration.**

To integrate your market data tools with Agent Builder, you need:
- **MCP node** documentation (not covered in this video)
- **Network transport** migration guide (see `MCP_NODE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
- **Public hosting** for MCP servers

**Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Understand Agent Builder workflow capabilities (DONE - from video)
2. ‚ùå Find MCP node setup documentation (STILL NEEDED)
3. ‚ùå Migrate market-mcp-server to HTTP/SSE transport (STILL NEEDED)
4. ‚ùå Deploy MCP server publicly (STILL NEEDED)
5. ‚ùå Configure authentication (STILL NEEDED)
