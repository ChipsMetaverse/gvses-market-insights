 The user is asking about the agent's knowledge source for technical 
  analysis and pattern detection. They're pointing to a /Volumes/WD My 
  Passport 264F Media/claude-voice-mcp/backend/training/knowledge directory 
  and asking if that's what the agent uses, and if not, how to train the 
  agent using that knowledge.

  Let me check what's in that directory and understand the current 
  architecture:

  1. The pattern detection we just implemented is in 
  backend/pattern_detection.py - this is deterministic code, not AI-based
  2. The agent's knowledge comes from the prompt in 
  elevenlabs/enhanced_agent_prompt.md 
  3. There might be training data in the cited directory that could be used 
  to enhance the agent

  Let me investigate the training/knowledge directory to understand what's 
  there.

⏺ Let me check what's in the training/knowledge directory and understand
   how the agent currently works:

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Volumes/WD\ My\ Passport\ 264F\
      Media/claude-voice-mcp/backend/training/knowledge/)
  ⎿  total 154824                                             
     drwxr-xr-x@ 16 MarcoPolo  staff       512 Sep  9 17:00 .
     drwxr-xr-x@  3 MarcoPolo  staff        96 Sep  9 17:00 ..
     … +27 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great, there's a wealth of technical analysis knowledge in PDF format. Now
   let me check how the agent is currently configured and whether it's using
   this knowledge.

⏺ Let me check how the agent is currently configured and what knowledge
  sources it uses:

⏺ Search(pattern: "training|knowledge|learn", head_limit: 10)
  ⎿  Found 10 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  There's an agent_training directory! Let me check that out.

⏺ Read(agent_training/knowledge_integration.py)
  ⎿  Read 511 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! So there is indeed a knowledge integration system already 
  built. Let me check how it's currently being used by the agent.

⏺ Read(agent_training/instructions.md)
  ⎿  Read 192 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check how this knowledge enhancement is currently being 
  integrated with the OpenAI agent and pattern detection.

⏺ Search(pattern: "knowledge_enhancer|AgentKnowledgeEnhancer|TechnicalAnalys
        isKnowledge")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check the test file to see how the knowledge enhancer is intended 
  to be used.

⏺ Read(test_enhanced_training.py)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check how the OpenAI service actually integrates these 
  components.

⏺ Search(pattern:
        "knowledge_integration|knowledge_enhancer|AgentKnowledgeEnhancer",
        path: "services", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 20)
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check how the OpenAI service is actually loading instructions and 
  if it's using this knowledge.

⏺ Search(pattern: "instructions.md|agent_training", path: "services",
        output_mode: "content", head_limit: 20)
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check how the OpenAI realtime service is initialized to understand 
  what instructions it uses.

⏺ Read(services/openai_realtime_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  That file is deprecated. Let me check the relay server which is the active
   one.

⏺ Read(services/openai_relay_server.py)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me see what instructions are being sent to OpenAI in the current relay
   server.

⏺ Read(services/openai_relay_server.py)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I see! The current architecture uses a voice-only interface for OpenAI. 
  The intelligence is handled by an agent orchestrator. Let me check how the
   orchestrator actually provides intelligence.

⏺ Read(services/agent_orchestrator.py)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I now understand the architecture! The system uses:
  1. OpenAI for voice-only interface (speech to text and text to speech)
  2. OpenAI's GPT-4o model with function calling in the agent orchestrator 
  for the actual intelligence
  3. The pattern detection is deterministic code we just implemented
  4. There's a knowledge integration module that exists but isn't currently 
  being used

  Let me look for the system prompt that the orchestrator uses to see how 
  the agent currently thinks.

⏺ Search(pattern: "system.*prompt|system.*message|You
        are|_get_system_prompt", path: "services/agent_orchestrator.py",
        output_mode: "content", head_limit: 30)
  ⎿  Found 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Let me see the full system prompt that the agent uses.

⏺ Read(services/agent_orchestrator.py)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding of the current system. Let me 
  create a comprehensive plan for integrating the knowledge from the 
  training materials.
