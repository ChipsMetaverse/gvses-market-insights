## 🔍 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Variable not found" Error

**Problem**: Node looking for a variable that doesn't exist

**Fix**: Check input variable names match output variable names
- Classification outputs: `classification_result`
- MCP outputs: `market_data`
- Chart Handler outputs: `chart_command`
- Chat Handler outputs: `chat_response`

### Issue: MCP Node Not Connecting

**Problem**: Server URL incorrect or server not running

**Fix**:
1. Verify URL: `https://market-mcp.fly.dev` (no trailing slash)
2. Test in browser: Should show health page
3. Click "Test authentication" in MCP node
4. If fails, check server deployment

### Issue: Multiple Inputs to G'sves Agent

**Problem**: Three different nodes connect to G'sves Agent

**Solution**: This is CORRECT! Agent Builder handles multiple inputs automatically
- Only ONE path will execute per request
- G'sves Agent receives data from whichever path was taken

### Issue: Condition Not Routing Correctly

**Problem**: Wrong branch activates

**Fix**: Check condition syntax exactly:
```
✅ Correct: {{classification_result.intent}} == "market_data"
❌ Wrong: {{intent}} == "market_data"
❌ Wrong: classification_result.intent == "market_data"
```

## ⚠️ MISSING NODES - Phase 2 Enhancement

**Status**: The 7-node workflow above is **complete and functional** for basic G'sves operations. However, Agent Builder has additional nodes that can significantly enhance capabilities:

### Node 8: Vector Store (OPTIONAL - Phase 2)

**Purpose**: Store and retrieve market knowledge, research, and historical analyses

**Configuration**:
```
Node Type: Vector Store
Name: Market Knowledge Base
Description: Historical market analysis and research documents
```

**Documents to Upload**:
- Market research reports
- Technical analysis guides
- Trading pattern descriptions
- Historical market commentary
- Educational content

**Connection**:
- Connect to Agent nodes (5, 6, 7) for knowledge retrieval
- Agents query Vector Store for relevant context
- Enhances responses with research-backed information

**Use Case**:
```
User: "What's a head and shoulders pattern?"
  ↓
Agent queries Vector Store
  ↓
Retrieves pattern documentation
  ↓
Response includes detailed explanation from knowledge base
```

**See**: VECTOR_STORE_AND_LOOP_NODES_GUIDE.md for complete configuration

### Node 9: Loop Node (OPTIONAL - Phase 2)

**Purpose**: Process multiple stocks, batch operations, watchlist analysis

**Configuration**:
```
Node Type: Loop
Loop Type: ForEach
Input Variable: {{stock_watchlist}}
Iterator: {{current_symbol}}
```

**Use Case - Watchlist Analysis**:
```
User: "Analyze my watchlist: TSLA, AAPL, NVDA"
  ↓
Loop: ForEach symbol in watchlist
  ├─ Get stock quote (MCP)
  ├─ Get latest news (MCP)
  ├─ Query Vector Store for historical context
  └─ Store analysis result
  ↓
Aggregate all results
  ↓
Return comprehensive watchlist analysis
```

**Integration Point**:
- Insert between Classification and MCP nodes
- Branch for "multiple stocks" queries
- Iterate through symbols calling MCP for each

**See**: VECTOR_STORE_AND_LOOP_NODES_GUIDE.md for complete configuration

### Additional Missing Nodes

**Not yet documented** (requires further research):
- Exec Node - Command execution
- Note Node - Workflow documentation
- User Type Node - User classification
- Guardrails Node - Input validation (see VIDEO_INSIGHTS_AGENT_BUILDER.md)

**Action**: See COMPLETE_NODE_TYPES_LIST.md for comprehensive list of all available nodes
