# Voice Input Audit Report

## Issues Found

### 1. ❌ Voice Recording Not Streaming
**Problem**: Audio is collected and sent AFTER recording stops, not during recording
- Current: Records audio chunks, sends single blob at end
- Required: Stream audio chunks continuously to ElevenLabs

**Fix Needed**: 
```javascript
// Instead of collecting chunks and sending at end:
mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
  // Convert to PCM and stream immediately
  convertAndStreamAudio(event.data);
};
```

### 2. ❌ Wrong Audio Format
**Problem**: Recording as `audio/webm`, ElevenLabs expects PCM
- Current: `{ type: 'audio/webm' }`
- Required: 16-bit PCM, 16kHz, mono

**Fix Needed**: Use Web Audio API to capture PCM directly

### 3. ❌ Mode Switching Not Working
**Problem**: Mode switch sends text "switch to overview mode" but agent doesn't recognize this
- UI shows mode change but agent behavior doesn't change
- Agent needs explicit mode instructions in each query

### 4. ⚠️ Database Errors
**Problem**: Session creation failing
```
Error: conversations_session_id_fkey constraint violation
```
- Sessions table not being populated
- Conversations can't be saved

### 5. ⚠️ Network Issues (Local Only)
**Problem**: Stock data fetching fails locally
```
[Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```
- Yahoo Finance API blocked or DNS issues
- Only affects market data, not voice functionality

## Testing Results

| Feature | Text Input | Voice Input | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Connection | ✅ Works | ✅ Connects | WebSocket OK |
| Send Message | ✅ Works | ❌ No response | Audio not streaming |
| Mode Switch | ⚠️ Visual only | ⚠️ Visual only | Agent doesn't respond |
| Response | ✅ Received | ❌ Silent | No audio trigger |

## Root Causes

### Voice Input Failure Chain:
1. User clicks "Start Voice Chat" → WebSocket connects ✅
2. User holds mic button → Recording starts ✅
3. Audio collected in chunks → Not streamed ❌
4. Recording stops → Single blob sent ❌
5. Format wrong (webm not PCM) → Agent can't process ❌
6. No response received → User sees nothing ❌

## Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Audio Streaming
- Implement continuous PCM streaming
- Use proper audio format (16-bit PCM, 16kHz)
- Stream chunks as they're recorded

### Priority 2: Fix Mode Switching
- Mode should affect agent's response format
- Currently only visual indicator changes
- Need to prepend mode context to each message

### Priority 3: Session Management
- Create session before saving conversations
- Handle database constraints properly

## Local vs Production

### Works Locally:
- Text input/output ✅
- WebSocket connection ✅
- UI interactions ✅

### Fails Locally:
- Voice input (format issue) ❌
- Stock data (network/DNS) ⚠️
- Database saves (constraint) ⚠️

### Production Considerations:
- HTTPS required for microphone access
- CORS configuration for WebSocket
- Database migrations needed

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Test WebSocket**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/elevenlabs/signed-url
# Should return signed URL ✅
```

2. **Test Voice (Current)**:
- Click "Start Voice Chat"
- Hold mic button
- Say "Tesla"
- Release button
- **Result**: No response ❌

3. **Test Text**:
- Type "Tesla" 
- Press Send
- **Result**: Response received ✅

## Recommended Solution

Replace current voice recording with proper PCM streaming:

```javascript
// Use ScriptProcessorNode for real-time PCM
const processor = audioContext.createScriptProcessor(4096, 1, 1);
processor.onaudioprocess = (e) => {
  const inputData = e.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
  const pcm16 = convertFloat32ToPCM16(inputData);
  const base64 = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...pcm16));
  sendAudioChunk(base64);
};
```

This will enable real-time voice streaming that ElevenLabs can process.
