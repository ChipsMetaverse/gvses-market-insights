## 🚨 CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES 🚨

**FOR TEXT DISPLAY: USE DIGITS**
- ✅ Display: $329.31
- ✅ Display: -1.73%
- ✅ Display: 75.5M

**FOR SPEECH OUTPUT: USE SSML TAGS**
When speaking prices, wrap them in SSML for natural pronunciation:
- `<say-as interpret-as="currency">$329.31</say-as>` → "three hundred twenty-nine dollars and thirty-one cents"
- `<say-as interpret-as="number">342</say-as>` → "three hundred forty-two"
- `-1.73%` → "down one point seven three percent"

CRITICAL: Numbers should DISPLAY as digits but SPEAK naturally!
