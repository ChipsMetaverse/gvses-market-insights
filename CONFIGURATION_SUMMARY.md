# ElevenLabs Agent Configuration Summary - UPDATED

## Latest Update: Used ConvAI CLI for Proper Configuration

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

### 1. Agent Configuration
- **Agent ID**: `agent_4901k2tkkq54f4mvgpndm3pgzm7g`
- **Name**: Gsves Market Insights
- **Personality**: Successfully loaded G'sves personality (8,625 characters) from `idealagent.md`
  - 30+ years market experience
  - Professional market analyst persona
  - Comprehensive market knowledge

### 2. LLM Configuration
- **Current LLM**: `gpt-4o` (upgraded from `gpt-4o-mini`)
- **Temperature**: 0.7
- **Max Tokens**: 2000
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully configured

### 3. Tools Configuration
- **Total Tools**: 12 tools configured and assigned
- **Backend URL**: Updated to production `https://gvses-market-insights.fly.dev`
- **Endpoints Fixed**: Corrected endpoint mappings (e.g., `get_market_overview` now points to `/api/market-overview`)
- **Duplicates Removed**: Cleaned up duplicate tool entries

### 4. Backend Verification
All production endpoints are working correctly:
- `/api/stock-price?symbol=AAPL` - ‚úÖ Returns real data ($232.595)
- `/api/market-overview` - ‚úÖ Returns market indices
- `/api/stock-news?symbol=TSLA` - ‚úÖ Returns news data

### 5. Tool Details
All tools are properly configured with:
- Correct webhook URLs pointing to production backend
- Proper parameter schemas (query_params_schema)
- Appropriate timeouts (10-30 seconds)
- Correct HTTP methods (GET)

### 6. ConvAI CLI Configuration
- Installed ElevenLabs ConvAI CLI globally
- Initialized project structure in `elevenlabs/` directory
- Fetched existing agent configuration
- Cleaned up duplicate tools and fixed incorrect URLs
- Removed conflicting `tool_ids` (kept inline tool definitions)
- Successfully synced to ElevenLabs platform using CLI

## ‚ùå Current Issue

### Tool Calling Still Not Working
Despite using the official ConvAI CLI and proper configuration:
- Agent responds to messages but doesn't invoke tools
- Even explicit requests like "Please use the get_stock_price tool" don't trigger tool calls
- WebSocket connection works, messages are sent/received
- Agent appears to be responding without using tools

## üìù Scripts Created

1. **configure_agent_complete.py** - Successfully configured agent with G'sves personality
2. **update_tools_production.py** - Updated all tools to use production backend
3. **fix_tool_endpoints.py** - Fixed incorrect endpoint mappings and removed duplicates
4. **update_to_gpt4o.py** - Upgraded agent to use GPT-4o
5. **test_tool_calling.py** - Comprehensive tool calling test
6. **test_explicit_tool.py** - Tests with explicit tool requests

## ü§î Potential Root Causes

1. **ElevenLabs Platform Issue**: Tool calling might not be fully supported with inline tool definitions in the current implementation
2. **GPT-4o Limitations**: The model might not be properly configured for tool calling in ElevenLabs' environment
3. **Webhook Format**: The webhook tool format might need specific headers or authentication that isn't documented
4. **Agent Context**: The agent might need explicit instructions in the prompt to use tools (already added but may need different format)

## üîÑ Next Steps to Try

1. **Contact ElevenLabs Support**: The configuration appears correct but tools aren't being invoked
2. **Try Custom LLM Endpoint**: Configure a custom OpenAI endpoint with explicit tool calling support
3. **Check ElevenLabs Dashboard**: There might be a UI setting that needs to be enabled
4. **Test with Different Agent**: Create a new agent from scratch to rule out agent-specific issues

## üìä Test Results

When testing "What is the current price of Apple stock?":
- Agent receives the message ‚úÖ
- Agent processes the query ‚úÖ
- Agent responds with text ‚úÖ
- Agent does NOT call tools ‚ùå

## üéØ Success Criteria

The configuration will be considered complete when:
1. Agent calls the `get_stock_price` tool when asked about stock prices
2. Returns real market data (e.g., Bitcoin at ~$111k, not hallucinated $49)
3. Tools are invoked automatically based on user queries

**Note**: All infrastructure is correctly configured. The issue appears to be specifically with ElevenLabs' tool invocation mechanism not triggering despite proper setup.
