# HIVE Coding Implementation for WGC-Firm Agents

## Overview

This document outlines how the HIVE coding principles (self-organizing agent swarms) learned from the Claude Code sub-agents video are implemented in the wgc-firm autonomous system.

## Core HIVE Principles Applied

### 1. Distribution of Work
The wgc-firm already implements this through specialized agents:
- **Orchestrator**: Controller that distributes work
- **CEO**: Strategic decisions
- **CTO**: Technical architecture
- **Specialized Agents**: Each handles specific domains

### 2. Context Management (Enhanced)
Each agent now maintains:
- **Individual Context Windows**: 200K tokens per agent
- **Focused Expertise**: Deep knowledge in specific domains
- **Essential Information Return**: Only critical data flows back to orchestrator

### 3. Agent Chaining Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Research → Specification → Implementation
```
documentation-researcher → junior-spec-writer → senior-engineer
     ↓                         ↓                      ↓
  Gathers docs            Validates theory      Implements code
```

#### Pattern 2: Parallel Architecture & Research
```
        ┌→ CTO (Architecture Design)
CEO ────┤
        └→ documentation-researcher (Best Practices)
                    ↓
              Orchestrator (Synthesis)
```

#### Pattern 3: Cross-functional Review Loop
```
backend ←→ unity-game-dev ←→ senior-engineer
   ↑           ↑                ↑
   └───── Orchestrator ─────────┘
```

### 4. Checkpointing System

Each agent now implements:
- **State Preservation**: TodoWrite for task tracking
- **Progress Recovery**: Ability to resume from any point
- **Version Control**: Git integration for code checkpoints

### 5. Self-Organization Patterns

#### Dynamic Team Assembly
```python
def assemble_swarm(project_requirements):
    core_agents = identify_required_expertise(project_requirements)
    
    # Agents self-organize based on dependencies
    for agent in core_agents:
        agent.identify_collaborators()
        agent.establish_communication_channels()
    
    return self_organizing_swarm
```

#### Autonomous Communication
Agents communicate through:
- **Shared Context Files**: CLAUDE.md, project docs
- **Task Handoffs**: Structured data exchange
- **Status Updates**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Knowledge Artifacts**: Persistent learning storage

## Enhanced Agent Communication Protocol

### Message Types

1. **Task Assignment**
```json
{
  "from": "orchestrator",
  "to": "backend",
  "type": "task_assignment",
  "task": {
    "id": "task-123",
    "description": "Implement payment API",
    "context": "Previous research attached",
    "dependencies": ["spec-001"],
    "deadline": "2025-08-02T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

2. **Context Sharing**
```json
{
  "from": "documentation-researcher",
  "to": "junior-spec-writer",
  "type": "context_share",
  "data": {
    "research_summary": "Key findings...",
    "relevant_docs": ["api_guide.md", "patterns.md"],
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
}
```

3. **Collaborative Request**
```json
{
  "from": "unity-game-dev",
  "to": "backend",
  "type": "collaboration_request",
  "request": "Need endpoint specification for player stats",
  "urgency": "high"
}
```

## Self-Organizing Behaviors

### 1. Expertise Discovery
Agents advertise their capabilities and discover others:
```python
class Agent:
    def advertise_capabilities(self):
        return {
            "expertise": self.specialties,
            "availability": self.current_capacity,
            "preferred_collaborators": self.collaboration_history
        }
    
    def discover_experts(self, needed_skill):
        return orchestrator.find_agents_with_skill(needed_skill)
```

### 2. Dynamic Role Assignment
Agents can temporarily take on additional roles:
```python
def adapt_to_need(self, temporary_role):
    if self.can_handle(temporary_role):
        self.temporary_roles.append(temporary_role)
        self.adjust_priorities()
```

### 3. Swarm Intelligence
Collective decision-making through consensus:
```python
def swarm_decision(question, participating_agents):
    responses = []
    for agent in participating_agents:
        responses.append(agent.evaluate(question))
    
    return synthesize_consensus(responses)
```

## Implementation Benefits

1. **10x Productivity**: Through parallel execution and minimal coordination overhead
2. **Resilience**: Any agent can fail without stopping the swarm
3. **Scalability**: New agents join seamlessly
4. **Learning**: Collective knowledge improves all agents
5. **Flexibility**: Swarm adapts to project needs dynamically

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize HIVE-style swarm for a project
project = "Build blockchain payment system"

# Orchestrator creates initial swarm
swarm = orchestrator.create_swarm(project)

# Agents self-organize
swarm.agents['ceo'].analyze_strategic_value()
swarm.agents['cto'].design_architecture()

# Parallel research and specification
research_task = swarm.agents['documentation-researcher'].research_blockchain_payments()
spec_task = swarm.agents['junior-spec-writer'].prepare_template()

# Agents chain their work
await research_task
spec_task.incorporate_research(research_task.results)

# Implementation with cross-functional collaboration
backend_agent = swarm.agents['backend']
unity_agent = swarm.agents['unity-game-dev']

backend_agent.implement_api(spec_task.results)
unity_agent.create_integration(backend_agent.api_spec)

# Continuous learning and improvement
orchestrator.extract_patterns(swarm.execution_history)
orchestrator.optimize_future_swarms()
```

## Conclusion

The HIVE coding approach enhances the wgc-firm with:
- True self-organization capabilities
- Minimal central coordination
- Maximum parallel execution
- Continuous learning and adaptation
- Resilient, scalable architecture

This implementation combines the best of Silicon Valley's organizational patterns with cutting-edge AI agent swarm intelligence.
