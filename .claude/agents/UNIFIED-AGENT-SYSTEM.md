# Unified Agent System: WGC-Firm + HIVE

## Two Powerful Patterns, One System

You now have access to two complementary agent patterns that excel in different scenarios:

### 1. **WGC-Firm Pattern** (Silicon Valley Style)
- **Best for**: Strategic projects, complex systems, long-term development
- **Structure**: Hierarchical with CEO, CTO, and specialized teams
- **Coordination**: Orchestrator manages workflow
- **Strengths**: Strategic alignment, resource optimization, scalability

### 2. **HIVE Pattern** (Contains Studio Style)
- **Best for**: Rapid app development, defined scope, 6-day sprints
- **Structure**: Sequential phases with specialist handoffs
- **Coordination**: Explicit agent chaining through phases
- **Strengths**: Speed, quality, predictable outcomes

## When to Use Each Pattern

### Use WGC-Firm When:
- Building complex enterprise systems
- Need strategic decision-making
- Project scope is evolving
- Multiple teams working in parallel
- Long-term maintenance required

### Use HIVE When:
- Building a specific app with defined features
- Working in sprint cycles
- Need predictable timeline
- Want polished, production-ready output
- Clear tech stack decided

## Combining Both Patterns

The patterns can work together:

```
1. WGC-Firm CEO analyzes market opportunity
2. WGC-Firm CTO defines technical architecture
3. HIVE workflow implements the specific app
4. WGC-Firm maintains and scales the system
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is your project scope clearly defined?
├─ YES → Use HIVE workflow
│   └─ Do you need ongoing strategy?
│       └─ YES → Add WGC-Firm leadership
└─ NO → Use WGC-Firm
    └─ Do you need rapid prototypes?
        └─ YES → Use HIVE for specific features
```

Task(subagent_type="wgc-firm-cto",
     prompt="Define architecture for scalable AI app")
```

### Phase 2: MVP (HIVE Workflow)
```
# Use meta-prompt to generate HIVE workflow
"Build AI productivity assistant with Next.js and OpenAI"
→ Generates complete 4-phase development plan
```

### Phase 3: Scale (WGC-Firm)
```
# Orchestrate growth
Task(subagent_type="wgc-firm-orchestrator",

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Strategy**: Use WGC-Firm for initial planning
2. **Execute with HIVE**: Implement specific features rapidly
3. **Maintain with WGC-Firm**: Long-term evolution
4. **Iterate with Both**: Strategic pivots + rapid execution

## Getting Started

### For a New Project:
1. Define your goal clearly
2. Choose your primary pattern:
   - Exploratory? → WGC-Firm
   - Specific app? → HIVE
3. Use the appropriate prompt/meta-prompt
4. Let agents work their magic

### For an Existing Project:
1. Use `local-file-researcher` to understand codebase
2. Deploy `code-quality-guardian` for assessment
3. Choose pattern based on next phase:
   - Refactoring? → WGC-Firm
   - New features? → HIVE

## The Power of Choice

You're not limited to one pattern. You have:
- **Strategic depth** from WGC-Firm
- **Execution speed** from HIVE
- **40+ specialists** ready to help
- **Flexibility** to mix and match

Whether you're building the next unicorn startup or shipping an MVP by Friday, you have the right agents and patterns for success.

## Remember

- **WGC-Firm** = Think like a CEO, build like a CTO
- **HIVE** = Ship like a studio, polish like a pro
- **Together** = Unlimited possibilities

The future of development isn't choosing between strategy and speed—it's having both at your command.
