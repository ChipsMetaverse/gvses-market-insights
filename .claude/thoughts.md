I shared a tutorial below that covers agent builder. The tech is new so there aren't many tools available your response will be given to an external agent. The agent cannot see what you can see so it is important for you too be meticulous and cohesively detailed in your response. I have given you rough draft, but it does not cover enough details for the AI assistant to work autonomously. Your response should only include "nuance details missing from the tutorial. Only return what is missing(see below):

To create a comprehensive tutorial on the Agent Builder, follow these detailed steps:

### Introduction to Agent Builder
Agent Builder is a powerful tool within the OpenAI platform that allows users to design and execute workflows using AI agents. These workflows can be integrated into websites, software, and other applications to automate tasks and provide intelligent responses. The Agent Builder interface is primarily a drag-and-drop UI, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Fundamental Tools in Agent Builder
1. **Agents**: These are the core components of the workflow, responsible for executing tasks and interacting with other tools. Agents can be configured with various settings such as name, instructions, and tools.
2. **End**: Marks the conclusion of the workflow, indicating where the process should stop.
3. **Notes**: Used for adding comments or explanations within the workflow. These do not affect the underlying workflow logic.
4. **File Search**: Allows users to search through files for relevant data. This tool is particularly useful for handling files stored in vector databases.
5. **Guardrails**: Helps ensure that the workflow adheres to certain rules or constraints. For example, it can prevent the output of inappropriate content.
6. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Manages the interaction between different models, allowing for more complex workflows.
7. **If-Else**: Enables conditional logic within the workflow, allowing actions to be taken based on specific conditions.
8. **While**: Allows for looping actions until a certain condition is met.
9. **User Approval**: Requires human intervention to approve or reject certain steps in the workflow.
10. **Transform**: Used to modify or manipulate data within the workflow.
11. **Set State**: Allows variables to be set or updated during the workflow execution.

### Creating a Workflow
1. **Start the Agent Builder**: Open the Agent Builder interface and select "New workflow."
2. **Add Nodes**: Drag and drop nodes from the left-side menu onto the canvas. Start with the "Start" node, followed by an "Agent" node.
3. **Connect Nodes**: Click and drag from the "Start" node's output port to the "Agent" node's input port to create a connection.
4. **Configure Agent**: Click on the "Agent" node to configure its settings. Set the name, instructions, and tools as needed.
5. **Add Sticky Notes**: Click on the "Agent" node and type your desired message in the text box that appears. For example, you can type "Hello world!" or "I love coffee."
6. **Add File Search**: Drag the "File Search" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "Agent" node. Configure the "File Search" node by entering the necessary parameters such as the vector store ID and query.
7. **Add Guardrails**: Drag the "Guardrails" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "File Search" node. Configure the "Guardrails" node by selecting the moderation categories you want to apply.
8. **Add MCP**: Drag the "MCP" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "Guardrails" node. Configure the "MCP" node by entering the necessary parameters such as the model name and instructions.
9. **Add If-Else**: Drag the "If/Else" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "MCP" node. Configure the "If/Else" node by entering the condition expression and case names.
10. **Add While**: Drag the "While" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "If/Else" node. Configure the "While" node by entering the loop condition expression.
11. **Add User Approval**: Drag the "User Approval" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "While" node. Configure the "User Approval" node by entering the approval message.
12. **Add Transform**: Drag the "Transform" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "User Approval" node. Configure the "Transform" node by entering the necessary parameters such as the transformation name, key, and value.
13. **Add Set State**: Drag the "Set State" node onto the canvas and connect it to the "Start" node. Configure the "Set State" node by assigning values to global variables.

### Testing the Workflow
1. **Preview the Workflow**: Click on the "Preview" tab to test the workflow. Enter a message that requires web search, such as "What is the weather in SF today?" and observe the output.
2. **Evaluate the Workflow**: If the workflow does not work as expected, check the "Evaluate traces" section for error logs and console logs.

### Publishing the Workflow
1. **Publish the Workflow**: Click the "Publish" button to publish the workflow. This will generate a workflow ID and current version.
2. **Integrate with ChatKit**: Use the ChatKit SDK to integrate the workflow into your application. Add the domain, workflow ID, and current version as needed.

### Future Plans
1. **GitHub Repository**: Create an entire code repository in GitHub to document the workflow and provide a starter template.
2. **Third-Party API Integration**: Integrate a third-party API into the workflow using the OpenAI API for more complex functionalities.

By following these detailed steps, you can effectively create and manage workflows using the Agent Builder, ensuring that your AI agents are integrated seamlessly into your applications.
