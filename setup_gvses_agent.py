## Trading Level System

### LTB (Load the Boat)
Current definition from codebase - strongest buy signal:
- Multiple technical confluences
- Deep retracements (61.8% Fibonacci)
- 200-day moving average alignment
- Historical support levels
- Suitable for larger position sizes

### ST (Swing Trade)
Current definition from codebase - medium-term entries:
- 50-day moving average alignment
- Consolidation zones
- 50% Fibonacci retracements
- Balanced risk/reward
- Suitable for swing traders

### QE (Quick Entry)
Current definition from codebase - near-term opportunities:
- Near recent highs
- Psychological resistance levels
- Breakout zones with elevated RSI
- Higher risk, higher reward potential

## Risk Management Principles
- Never risk more than 2% of capital per trade
- Always use stop losses
- Position sizing based on account size
- Diversification across sectors
- Exit strategy defined before entry

## Analysis Framework
1. Check current price and moving averages
2. Identify LTB/ST/QE levels
3. Validate with technical indicators (RSI, MACD, volume)
4. Consider news catalysts
5. Calculate risk/reward ratio
6. Define entry, stop, and targets
7. Determine position size
8. Execute with discipline

# Document 2: Options Trading Quick Reference
options_content = """# Options Trading Quick Reference for G'sves

## The Greeks (Simplified)

**Delta (Œî)**: How much option price moves per $1 stock move
- Call delta: 0 to 1.0 (50 delta = $0.50 move per $1 stock move)
- Put delta: -1.0 to 0 (negative because puts gain when stock drops)
- ATM options: ~0.50 delta
- Deep ITM: ~1.0 delta (moves like stock)
- Far OTM: ~0.10 delta (barely moves)

**Theta (Œò)**: Time decay (money lost per day)
- Always negative for option buyers
- Accelerates near expiration
- Weekly options: High theta (lose value FAST)

**Vega (ŒΩ)**: Sensitivity to volatility changes
- High vega = price changes a lot with IV changes
- Earnings = high vega due to uncertainty

**Gamma (Œì)**: Rate of delta change
- Highest at-the-money near expiration
- Tells you how fast delta will change

## Common Strategies

**Covered Call**: Own stock + sell call (income generation)
**Cash-Secured Put**: Sell put + hold cash (get paid to buy stock lower)
**Vertical Spread**: Buy one strike, sell another (defined risk/reward)
**Iron Condor**: Sell OTM put spread + OTM call spread (range-bound income)

## G'sves Weekly Options Selection Process

1. **Find stock near LTB/ST/QE level**
2. **Check IV Rank** - prefer < 50 for buying options
3. **Select strike based on view**:
   - Aggressive: Slightly OTM (higher R/R, lower probability)
   - Conservative: ATM (balanced)
4. **Check Greeks**:
   - Delta > 0.40 for calls
   - Theta not too high (< $0.20/day for small positions)
   - Vega moderate
5. **Calculate risk/reward**: Max loss = premium paid
6. **Set profit target**: 50-100% gain typical for weeklies
7. **Position size**: 2-5% of portfolio max

## Risk Management

- Max 2-5% of portfolio per options trade
- Stop loss at 50% of premium paid (common)
- Close winners at 50-100% gain
- Exit losers when thesis invalidated
- Don't hold through expiration (theta accelerates)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Buying too far OTM (low delta needs huge move)
2. Holding through expiration (theta kills you)
3. Ignoring IV (buying high IV = overpaying)
4. Too much size (options can go to zero)
5. No stop loss (hope is not a strategy)
6. Trading earnings without understanding IV crush

Add to `backend/.env`:

### Option A: Use Responses API Directly (Recommended)

# transcript = await openai_relay_server.receive_transcript()
# response_text = process_voice_transcript(transcript, session_id)
# await openai_relay_server.send_tts(response_text, session_id)
```

### Option B: Use Assistant with Threads

```python

    # Create or use existing thread
    if not thread_id:

   - Update backend/.env with GVSES_ASSISTANT_ID

3. **Optional: Use Agent Builder UI**:
   - Import assistant ID: {assistant.id}
   - Visual workflow editor at: https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder
   - Connect MCP nodes for advanced routing

4. **Add custom tools** (your MCP servers):
