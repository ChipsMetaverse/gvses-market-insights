# ElevenLabs Agent Market Data Issue - Solution

## The Problem
Your ElevenLabs agent is **hallucinating market data** because it has no access to real information:
- Bitcoin shown as **$49.57** instead of actual **$111,986**
- No tools configured (`tools: null`)
- Agent prompt claims to have tools that don't exist

## Why This Happens
1. The agent's prompt mentions tools like `get_realtime_stock_data` that **aren't configured**
2. The LLM model tries to be helpful and **makes up prices** based on outdated training data
3. Your backend has the correct data but the agent **can't access it**

## Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Dashboard Configuration (Recommended)
Since the API doesn't properly expose tools configuration, use the dashboard:

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents/agent_4901k2tkkq54f4mvgpndm3pgzm7g
2. Look for **"Tools"** or **"Functions"** section
3. Add these webhook tools:

```json
{
  "name": "get_stock_price",
  "type": "webhook",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/api/stock-price",
  "method": "GET",
  "parameters": {
    "symbol": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Stock/crypto symbol (e.g., AAPL, BTC-USD)"
    }
  }
}

{
  "name": "get_market_overview",
  "type": "webhook", 
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/api/market-overview",
  "method": "GET"
}
```

### Option 2: Use Frontend Enrichment
Since your frontend already fetches real data, have it inject current prices into the conversation context:

```javascript
// Before sending to ElevenLabs
const enrichedMessage = await enrichWithMarketData(userMessage);
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "contextual_update",
  text: `Current BTC: $${currentBTCPrice}`
}));
```

### Option 3: Proxy Through Backend
Route all agent messages through your backend which can detect price queries and inject real data:

```python
# In backend
if "bitcoin" in user_message.lower():
    btc_price = get_btc_price()  # Returns $111,986
    context = f"Current BTC price: ${btc_price}"
    # Send context to agent before user message
```

### Option 4: Update Agent Prompt (Temporary)
Make the agent honest about its limitations:

```
You are G'sves, a market analyst.

IMPORTANT: I do NOT have access to real-time market data.
When asked about current prices, I should:
1. Explain I don't have live data access
2. Suggest checking financial websites
3. Offer general market analysis instead

I should NEVER make up or guess prices.
```

## Current Architecture
```
User → ElevenLabs Agent (no tools) → Hallucinates prices ❌
       ↓
Backend (has real data from MCP) → Not connected to agent ✅
```

## Needed Architecture
```
User → ElevenLabs Agent → Tools/Webhooks → Backend → MCP Server → Real data ✅
```

## Testing
After configuring tools, test with:
```bash
./test_market_query.sh
```

Expected results:
- Bitcoin: ~$111,000 ✅ (not $49)
- Apple: ~$232 ✅
- S&P 500: ~$648 ✅

## Summary
The agent needs **tools configured in the dashboard** to access your backend's real market data. Without tools, it will continue hallucinating prices based on its training data.
